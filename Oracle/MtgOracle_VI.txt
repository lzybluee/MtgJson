<Rulings>2004/10/04: Whether the land is a basic land or not is unchanged by this effect.
2004/10/04: More than one <Blanket of Night> has no meaningful additional effect.
2004/10/04: Anything which counts the number of Swamps on the battlefield will not double count an actual Swamp card while <Blanket of Night> is on the battlefield.
2004/10/04: The land can now be tapped for black mana in addition to any other abilities it already has. This works just as if the text "{T}: Add {B}" was added to each mana-producing land. In other words, the land can be tapped for its own ability _or_ it can be tapped for black mana. Not both.
2004/10/04: The lands do not get the name "Swamp" in addition to their current name. This is a reversal of older rulings.
2004/10/04: The ability is a land type change effect so it is ordered along with other land type change effects in the order they entered the battlefield.
2004/10/04: It can affect lands which do not produce mana.
2006/10/15: If this effect is applied to a snow land, the land is now a snow Swamp and not just a regular Swamp.</Rulings>

2008/04/01: If the creature card put onto the battlefield has protection from black (or anything that prevents this from legally being attached), this won't be able to attach to it. Then this will go to the graveyard as a state-based action, causing the creature to be sacrificed.
2009/10/01: The sacrifice occurs only if you cast it using its own ability. If you cast it using some other effect (for instance, if it gained flash from Vedalken Orrery), then it won't be sacrificed.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Paying cumulative upkeep is always optional. If it's not paid, the permanent with cumulative upkeep is sacrificed. Partial payments of the total cumulative upkeep cost can't be made. For example, if a permanent with "cumulative upkeep {1}" has three age counters on it when its cumulative upkeep ability triggers, it gets another age counter and then its controller chooses to either pay {4} or sacrifice the permanent.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the draw part of the effect is skipped due to a replacement effect, the discard part of the effect is not skipped.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put <Anvil of Bogardan> onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.
2013/04/15: The triggered ability is put onto the stack after you have already drawn your card for the turn.
2013/04/15: If there are two Anvils on the battlefield, they trigger and resolve separately. This means that you first draw one card and discard one card, and then do it again. You do not draw two cards and then discard two cards.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The generic X cost is still considered generic even if there is a requirement that a specific color be used for it. For example, "only black mana can be spent this way". This distinction is important for effects which reduce the generic portion of a spell's cost.
2004/10/04: This can lower the cost to zero, but not below zero.
2004/10/04: The effect is cumulative.
2004/10/04: The lower cost is not optional like with some other cost reducers.
