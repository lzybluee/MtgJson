<CardText>+1: Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the other on the bottom of your library.

<Rulings>2014/11/07: If you control Teferi's emblem, the rule that says you can activate a loyalty ability only if none of that permanent's loyalty abilities have been activated that turn still applies. In other words, you could activate a planeswalker's loyalty ability once on your turn and once on each of your opponents' turns.
2014/11/07: If you control The Chain Veil (from the Magic 2015 core set) and its activated ability has resolved, and you also control Teferi's emblem, for each planeswalker you control, you can activate one of its loyalty abilities during that turn any time you could cast an instant, and then you may activate a loyalty ability again that turn (choosing the same loyalty ability or a different one) any time you could cast an instant.</Rulings>

<CardText>+2: Discard up to two cards, then draw that many cards.

<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/07: You may choose to discard zero cards as the first ability resolves. In that case, you won't draw any cards.
2014/11/07: You choose which artifact to sacrifice as the second ability resolves. You must sacrifice an artifact if you control at least one at that time. For example, if you control two artifacts when you activate the second ability, but the artifact you intended to sacrifice is destroyed in response, you must sacrifice the other artifact as the ability resolves.
2014/11/07: The ability of Daretti's emblem will return the artifact card only if it's still in your graveyard when the delayed triggered ability resolves at the beginning of the next end step. If the artifact card left your graveyard before that point (even if it was put back into your graveyard), the ability won't return it to the battlefield.</Rulings>
