<Artist>Kristen Bishop</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

Tetravus enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it.
At the beginning of your upkeep, you may remove any number of +1/+1 counters from Tetravus. If you do, create that many 1/1 colorless Tetravite artifact creature tokens. They each have flying and "This creature can't be enchanted."
At the beginning of your upkeep, you may exile any number of tokens created with Tetravus. If you do, put that many +1/+1 counters on Tetravus.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the <Tetravus> is destroyed when the Tetravites are off the card, they are not destroyed, they are just orphaned.

2004/10/04: Only Tetravites from this specific <Tetravus> may be used for the ability. Ones from a different <Tetravus> can't.

Remove a +1/+1 counter from Triskelion: It deals 1 damage to any target.</CardText>
<Artist>Douglas Shuler</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: If you activate the ability of an attacking or blocking <Triskelion> during the declare blockers step, it will deal less combat damage as a result. If you wait until the combat damage step, but <Triskelion> is dealt lethal damage, it'll be destroyed before you get a chance to activate its ability.
2010/08/15: If <Triskelion> has damage marked on it, activating its ability may cause that damage to become lethal. For example, say a <Triskelion> with two +1/+1 counters on it has been dealt 2 damage earlier in the turn. If you activate its ability by removing a +1/+1 counter from it, it now has 2 toughness and is destroyed as a state-based action. You won't be able to remove the other +1/+1 counter from it to activate its ability again. The first activation of the ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: On the other hand, you can tap <City of Brass>, put its triggered ability on the stack, and then respond to that ability by casting an instant or activating an ability using that mana. In that case, the instant spell or activated ability will resolve first.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/08/01: If another player takes control of the Factory while it is animated, that player keeps control until the control effect ends. They do not lose control just because the card stops being an Assembly-Worker. Note that Auras which steal cards will go to the graveyard if the permanent they enchant is no longer valid.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
2016/06/08: Once turned into a creature, <Mishra's Factory>'s last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.
2016/06/08: If you turn <Mishra's Factory> into a creature but haven't controlled it continuously since your most recent turn began, you won't be able to activate its first or last ability.</Rulings>
