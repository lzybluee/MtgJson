For example, if the ability resolves with an X of 4, then Giant Solifuge is put onto the battlefield, the Solifuge can't attack or block that turn.
2006/02/01: If you use <Droning Bureaucrats>'s ability after you have declared attackers but before your opponent declares blockers, the restriction will apply to only your opponent's creatures. Creatures that are already attacking will be unaffected.
2006/02/01: Creature lands and most token creatures have converted mana cost 0. If a creature on the battlefield has {X} in its mana cost, treat X as 0.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/02/01: When the creatures are exiled, any Auras or Equipment on them fall off and any counters on them are removed. When they return to the battlefield, they come back untapped and are treated as new versions of the cards.
2006/02/01: Normally, the creatures will return to the battlefield at the end of the same turn they were exiled. But if they're exiled during the End step, it's too late to return them this turn. They have to wait to return to the battlefield until the next End step.

2010/08/15: <Leyline of the Void>'s second ability doesn't affect token permanents that would be put into an opponent's graveyard from the battlefield. They'll be put into that graveyard as normal (causing any applicable triggered abilities to trigger), then they'll cease to exist.
2010/08/15: If your opponent discards a card while you control <Leyline of the Void>, abilities that function when that card is discarded (such as Liliana's Caress's ability, or a madness ability of the discarded card) still work, even though that card never reaches that player's graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of the discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.
2016/06/08: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans and "scryed" if applicable. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order.

For example, Seeds of Strength targeting Atog (target #1), the same Atog (target #2), and Scryb Sprites (target #3) can be changed so it targets the same Scryb Sprites (target #1), Eager Cadet (target #2), and Alpha Myr (target #3). If changing one of the targets would be impossible, then you can't change any of the others.

<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>

<Rulings>2006/02/01: <Ink-Treader Nephilim>'s ability is mandatory and will create a copy targeting each possible creature whether you want it to or not. You control all the copies of the spell (even if you didn't control the original spell), so you choose the order to put them on the stack.
2006/02/01: Even though you control the copies, the ability cares about who cast the original spell when determining which other creatures that spell could target. If the original spell has a targeting restriction that refers to "an opponent," the copies will see that from the perspective of the original spell's controller. For example, if your opponent casts a spell that says "Destroy target creature an opponent controls" targeting your <Ink-Treader Nephilim>, its ability will create a copy for each other creature the original spell could target: the rest of your creatures. However, since you control the copies, all the copies won't resolve for having illegal targets.
2006/02/01: <Ink-Treader Nephilim>'s ability will trigger off a spell with multiple targets if all of those targets are <Ink-Treader Nephilim>. For example, Seeds of Strength cast with <Ink-Treader Nephilim> as each of the three targets will cause the ability to trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/02/01: If you use the first ability, <Mizzium Transreliquat> loses both of its copy abilities until the effect wears off (unless it copied itself or another <Mizzium Transreliquat>). When it wears off, <Mizzium Transreliquat> loses all abilities it gained this way and goes back to being what it was before.
2006/02/01: The second ability doesn't wear off. If you use it, <Mizzium Transreliquat> becomes a copy of target artifact permanently and gains the {1}{U}{R} ability. It no longer has the {3} ability (unless it copied itself or another <Mizzium Transreliquat>).
2006/02/01: An artifact's "copiable values" are those printed on it, as modified by other copy effects, plus any values set by "enters the battlefield as" abilities. Counters and other effects aren't copied. For example, if you copy a Gruul War Plow that's been turned into an artifact creature, the result will be just an artifact.
2006/02/01: The results of all copy effects are copied. If <Mizzium Transreliquat> is copied, the copy will be a <Mizzium Transreliquat> after applying all copy effects currently affecting the original. For example, Copy Artifact copying a Transreliquat that's using its first ability to copy an Izzet Signet will be an Izzet Signet. The effect won't wear off at the end of the turn; rather, the Copy Artifact will remain an Izzet Signet for the rest of the game.
2006/02/01: If you use <Mizzium Transreliquat>'s abilities multiple times in a turn in response to one another, then each time one of those abilities resolves, it will overwrite whatever the permanent was copying. The Transreliquat will wind up as a copy of the artifact targeted by the last ability to resolve. When the turn ends, all instances of its first ability will wear off at the same time. If one of those was the last copy ability to resolve, the Transreliquat will become what it was before those abilities resolved. This will likely be either the original <Mizzium Transreliquat> or whatever it copied with the last instance of its second ability to resolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/02/01: "Until your next turn" means the effect wears off as soon as your next turn starts, even before you untap. It's basically the same as "until the end of the turn of the player who immediately precedes you."
2006/02/01: The card is cast using all normal rules and restrictions for casting spells. Casting it means you'll have to pay its mana cost, and it will go to the graveyard after it resolves or is countered. The only thing that's different is you're casting it from the Exile zone.
