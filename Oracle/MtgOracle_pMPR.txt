<CardText>Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among any number of target creatures and/or players.
Fireball costs {1} more to cast for each target beyond the first.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Flame Javelin> is red even if you spend six green mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Flame Javelin> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {R}{R}{R} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Flame Javelin> by spending {R}{R}{R}, {2}{R}{R}, {4}{R}, or {6}.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jim Pavelec</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: <Volcanic Fallout> can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Countersquall). Those spells will still resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter <Volcanic Fallout> won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.</Rulings>

<CardText>Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.)
Bituminous Blast deals 4 damage to target creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Aleksi Briclot</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2009/05/01: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2009/05/01: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2009/05/01: You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.
2009/05/01: If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
2009/05/01: After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.</Rulings>

<CardText>As an additional cost to cast Harrow, sacrifice a land.
Search your library for up to two basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield. Then shuffle your library.</CardText>
<Artist>Lars Grant-West</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The sacrifice of a land is part of the cost of casting <Harrow>. You can't pay this cost more than once to get a multiple effect.
2004/10/04: The two lands do not count toward your normal one land you can play each turn.
2004/10/04: Because the "search" requires you to find a card with certain characteristics, you don't have to find the card if you don't want to.</Rulings>

Landfall — If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, Searing Blaze deals 3 damage to that player and 3 damage to that creature instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: Whether you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn is checked as this spell resolves, not as you cast it.
2010/03/01: Having more than one land enter the battlefield under your control this turn provides no additional benefit.
2010/03/01: The landfall ability checks for an action that has happened in the past. It doesn't matter if a land that entered the battlefield under your control previously in the turn is still on the battlefield, is still under your control, or is still a land.
2010/03/01: Once the spell resolves, having a land enter the battlefield under your control provides no further benefit.
2010/03/01: The effect of this spell's landfall ability replaces its normal effect. If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, only the landfall-based effect happens.
2010/03/01: You must choose two targets as you cast <Searing Blaze>: a player and a creature that player controls. If you can't (because there are no creatures on the battlefield, perhaps), then you can't cast the spell.
2010/03/01: If either target is illegal by the time <Searing Blaze> resolves, it still deals damage to the other target.</Rulings>
