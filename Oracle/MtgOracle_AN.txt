The same is true if the targeted creature's power becomes greater than <Old Man of the Sea>'s power before the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: The ability doesn't care whether <Old Man of the Sea> remains under your control, only that <Old Man of the Sea> remains tapped and its power remains large enough. If an opponent gains control of <Old Man of the Sea>, you'll keep control of the affected creature (until <Old Man of the Sea> stops being tapped or it no longer has enough power).
2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the targeted permanent remains a legal target for the ability, only that it's on the battlefield and its power remains small enough. The effect will continue to apply to it even if it gains shroud, stops being a creature, or would no longer be a legal target for any other reason. If it stops being a creature, its power is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: This effect does not prevent damage, it prevents the damage from turning into loss of life. So the full damage is dealt (and abilities that trigger on damage being dealt still trigger), but the full loss of life is not applied.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>
