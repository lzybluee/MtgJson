<CardText>+2: During target opponent's next turn, creatures that player controls attack Gideon Jura if able.
-2: Destroy target tapped creature.
0: Until end of turn, Gideon Jura becomes a 6/6 Human Soldier creature that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Aleksi Briclot</Artist>
<Multiverseid>238329</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability causes creatures to attack him if able. If, during the affected player's declare attackers step, a creature they control is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2010/06/15: If a creature controlled by the affected player can't attack <Gideon Jura> (because he's no longer on the battlefield, for example), that player may have it attack you, another one of your planeswalkers, or nothing at all.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability applies during each combat phase of the affected player's next turn (as opposed to applying during the affected player's next combat phase). The distinction is relevant if there are no combat phases during that turn (due to Fatespinner's effect, for example) or there are multiples (due to World at War, for example).
2010/06/15: If <Gideon Jura> becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. <Gideon Jura> was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. That's because the effect states a true thing about a set of creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, whatever creatures the targeted opponent controls during the declare attackers step of their next turn must attack <Gideon Jura> if able. This includes creatures that come under that player's control after the ability has resolved and creatures that have lost all abilities.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2010/06/15: If you activate <Gideon Jura>'s third ability and then unpreventable damage is dealt to him (due to Unstable Footing, for example), that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on <Gideon Jura> (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If the total amount of damage marked on <Gideon Jura> is lethal damage, he's destroyed as a state-based action. If <Gideon Jura> has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2010/06/15: Say you activate <Gideon Jura>'s third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack <Gideon Jura> (since he's still a planeswalker). Then <Gideon Jura> may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him! During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.
2010/06/15: If <Gideon Jura> becomes a creature, he may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any) unless he began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when <Gideon Jura> came under your control, not when he became a creature.
2011/01/22: The first ability only affects the declaration of attackers. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking (thanks to Hero of Bladehold, Preeminent Captain, or the Ninjutsu ability, for example), that creature's controller may choose the defending player or planeswalker that it will be attacking in the normal way.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2010/08/15: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2010/08/15: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2010/08/15: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: The Illusion creature type and the triggered ability that <Phantasmal Image> gains as part of its copy effect are both copiable values that other effects may copy.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Phantasmal Image>), then <Phantasmal Image> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is a token, <Phantasmal Image> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Phantasmal Image> is not a token in this case.

2017/03/14: If <Phantasmal Image> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Phantasmal Image> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.</Rulings>

2010/08/15: If the targeted spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), you can't choose a different mode.
2010/08/15: If you cast <Redirect> targeting a spell that targets a spell on the stack (like Cancel does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself. You can, however, change that spell's target to <Redirect>. If you do, that spell won't resolve when it tries to resolve because <Redirect> will have left the stack by then.
2010/08/15: <Redirect> can target any spell, not just an instant or sorcery spell. For example, you could use it to change the target of an Aura spell. However, if the targeted spell has no targets (for example, if it's an instant or sorcery spell that doesn't specifically use the word "target," or if it's a creature spell), <Redirect> won't have any effect on it.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: <Turn to Frog> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
2014/07/18: If the affected creature gains an ability after <Turn to Frog> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2014/07/18: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2014/07/18: If one of the Theros block Gods is affected by <Turn to Frog>, it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities. If it stops being a creature, perhaps because your devotion to its color(s) decreased, it will be a legendary blue enchantment with no abilities.

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The player who is being controlled is still the active player.
2009/10/01: While controlling another player, you also continue to make your own choices and decisions.
2009/10/01: While controlling another player, you make all choices and decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. For example: -- You choose which lands the other player plays. -- You choose which spells the other player casts, and make all decisions as those spells are cast and as they resolve. For example, you choose the value of X for that player's Earthquake, the target for that player's Lightning Bolt, what mana that player spends to cast Day of Judgment, and what card that player gets with Diabolic Tutor. -- You choose which activated abilities the other player activates, and make all decisions as those abilities are activated and as they resolve. For example, you can have your opponent sacrifice their creatures to their Vampire Aristocrat or have your opponent's Caller of Gales give one of your creatures flying. -- You make all decisions for the other player's triggered abilities, including what they target and any decisions made when they resolve. -- You choose which creatures controlled by the other player attack, who or what they attack, and how they assign their combat damage. -- You make any choices and decisions that player would make for any other reason. For example, you could cast Fact or Fiction, choose that player to divide the revealed cards into piles, and thus divide those cards into piles yourself.
2009/10/01: You can't make the affected player concede. That player may choose to concede at any time, even while you're controlling their turn.
2009/10/01: You can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices — you can't do anything that player couldn't do. You can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the affected player would normally make (such as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. (In other words, if the affected player wouldn't make a decision, you wouldn't make that decision on their behalf.) You also can't make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2009/10/01: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time Sorin's first ability resolves, the entire ability doesn't resolve. You won't gain life.
2009/10/01: You only control the player. You don't control any of the other player's permanents, spells, or abilities.
2009/10/01: If the player affected by Sorin's third ability skips their next turn, the ability will wait. You'll control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
2009/10/01: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
2009/10/01: You could gain control of yourself using Sorin's third ability, but unless you do so to overwrite someone else's player-controlling effect, this doesn't do anything.
2009/10/01: You can use only the affected player's resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; you can't use your own. Similarly, you can use the affected player's resources only to pay that player's costs; you can't spend them on your costs.
2009/10/01: For a player's life total to become 10, what actually happens is that the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the targeted opponent's life total is 4 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to gain 6 life; alternately, if the targeted player's life total is 17 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 7 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2009/10/01: Sorin's third ability allows you to control another player. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Sorin's second ability causes the targeted opponent's team's life total to become 10. Only the targeted player is actually considered to have actually gained or lost life.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: <Vengeful Pharaoh> must be in your graveyard when combat damage is dealt to you or a planeswalker you control in order for its ability to trigger. That is, it can't die and trigger from your graveyard during the same combat damage step.
2011/09/22: If <Vengeful Pharaoh> is no longer in your graveyard when the triggered ability would resolve, the triggered ability won't do anything.
2011/09/22: If the attacking creature is an illegal target when the triggered ability tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. <Vengeful Pharaoh> will remain in your graveyard.
2011/09/22: If multiple creatures deal combat damage to you simultaneously, <Vengeful Pharaoh> will only trigger once.
2011/09/22: If multiple creatures deal combat damage to you and to a planeswalker you control simultaneously, <Vengeful Pharaoh> will trigger twice. The first trigger will cause <Vengeful Pharaoh> to be put on top of your library. The second trigger will then do nothing, as <Vengeful Pharaoh> is no longer in your graveyard when it tries to resolve. Note that the second trigger will do nothing even if <Vengeful Pharaoh> is put back into your graveyard before it tries to resolve, as it's a different <Vengeful Pharaoh> than the one that was there before.
2011/09/22: If your own attacking creatures deal combat damage to you or a planeswalker you control (perhaps because combat damage was redirected), <Vengeful Pharaoh> will still trigger. You must target and destroy one of your own attacking creatures.</Rulings>

<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra (Loyalty: 3)</Type>
<ManaCost>3R (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>+1: Chandra, the Firebrand deals 1 damage to any target.
-2: When you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
-6: Chandra, the Firebrand deals 6 damage to each of up to six targets.</CardText>
<Artist>D. Alexander Gregory</Artist>
<Multiverseid>220146</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Chandra's second ability creates a delayed triggered ability that will copy the next instant or sorcery spell you cast that turn, regardless of whether that spell has targets.
2011/09/22: When the delayed trigger resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2011/09/22: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2011/09/22: If the spell Chandra copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2011/09/22: If the spell Chandra copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Consume Spirit does), the copy has the same value of X.
2011/09/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling after activating Chandra's second ability, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage.
2011/09/22: When you activate Chandra's last ability, you choose up to six target creatures and/or players. No damage is divided, and Chandra can't deal more than 6 damage to any one target. Chandra deals 6 damage to each target that is still legal when the ability resolves.</Rulings>

2010/08/15: Spells that create prevention effects affecting the targeted creature can still be cast, and abilities that create prevention effects affecting the targeted creature can still be activated. However, damage prevention shields (including those created before <Combust> was cast) don't have any effect on the damage dealt by <Combust>. If such a prevention effect has an additional effect, the additional effect will still work (if possible).
2010/08/15: If a static ability would prevent damage from being dealt to the targeted creature, it fails to prevent the damage dealt by <Combust>. If that ability has an additional effect that doesn't depend on the amount of damage prevented, that additional effect will still work. It's applied just once as <Combust> resolves.
2010/08/15: Effects that replace or redirect damage without using the word "prevent" aren't affected by <Combust>; they'll work as normal.
2010/08/15: If a creature is dealt lethal damage by <Combust>, it can still regenerate. If it does, the damage marked on it will be removed from it.</Rulings>

<Artist>jD</Artist>
<Multiverseid>233722</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Reverberate> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2010/08/15: When <Reverberate> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2010/08/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2010/08/15: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Reverberate>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2010/08/15: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

If those spells are blue or black at the time they would resolve, they will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter the spell you control simply won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2010/08/15: If a creature you control is being targeted by a spell when <Autumn's Veil> resolves, nothing happens right away. When that spell would resolve, its color is checked. If it's blue or black, that creature will be an illegal target for that spell, and will be unable to be affected by it.

2010/08/15: <Autumn's Veil> affects any spells and creatures you happen to control at any point during the rest of the turn, not just spells and creatures you control as it resolves.

<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>221895</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: Activating <Cudgel Troll>'s ability causes a "regeneration shield" to be created for it. The next time <Cudgel Troll> would be destroyed that turn, the regeneration shield is used up instead. This works only if <Cudgel Troll> is dealt lethal damage, dealt damage from a source with deathtouch, or affected by a spell or ability that says to "destroy" it. Other effects that cause <Cudgel Troll> to be put into the graveyard (such as reducing its toughness to 0 or sacrificing it) don't destroy it, so regeneration won't save it. If it hasn't been used, the regeneration shield goes away as the turn ends.
2010/08/15: To work, the regeneration shield must be created before <Cudgel Troll> is destroyed. This usually means activating its ability during the declare blockers step, or in response to a spell or ability that would destroy it.
2010/08/15: If <Cudgel Troll> is dealt lethal damage and is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch during the same combat damage step, a single regeneration shield will save it.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has "{1}{G}: Regenerate this creature." (The next time the creature would be destroyed this turn, it isn't. Instead tap it, remove all damage from it, and remove it from combat.)</CardText>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>220190</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Activating the ability granted to the enchanted creature causes a "regeneration shield" to be created for it. The next time that creature would be destroyed that turn, the regeneration shield is used up instead. This works only if the creature is dealt lethal damage, dealt damage from a source with deathtouch, or affected by a spell or ability that says to "destroy" it. Other effects that cause the creature to be put into the graveyard (such as reducing its toughness to 0 or sacrificing it) don't destroy it, so regeneration won't save it. If it hasn't been used, the regeneration shield goes away as the turn ends.
2011/09/22: To work, the regeneration shield must be created before the enchanted creature is destroyed. This usually means activating its ability during the declare blockers step, or in response to a spell or ability that would destroy it.
2011/09/22: If the enchanted creature is dealt lethal damage and is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch during the same combat damage step, a single regeneration shield will save it.
2013/07/01: <Trollhide> needs to be attached to the creature as the ability that creates the regeneration shield is activated, but after that, the regeneration shield will be created and remain in effect even if <Trollhide> is no longer attached to the creature.</Rulings>
