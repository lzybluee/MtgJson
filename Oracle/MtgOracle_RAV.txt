<Rulings>2005/10/01: The color you choose as the spell resolves has nothing to do with the color or colors shared by the affected creatures.
2005/10/01: All creatures that share a color are affected, even your own.
2005/10/01: A creature "shares a color" with any creature that is at least one of its colors. For example, a green-white creature shares a color with creatures that are green, white, green-white, red-white, black-green, and so on.
2005/10/01: If it targets a colorless creature, it doesn't affect any other creatures. A colorless creature shares a color with nothing, not even other colorless creatures.
2005/10/01: You check which creatures share a color with the target when the spell resolves.
2005/10/01: Only one creature is targeted. If that creature leaves the battlefield or otherwise becomes an illegal target, the entire spell doesn't resolve. No other creatures are affected.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/10/01: The damage prevention shield lasts for the rest of the turn, and you gain life each time that shield prevents 1 or more damage.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/10/01: If a damage prevention effect and <Ghosts of the Innocent>'s effect would apply to the same damage, the player or the controller of the creature being dealt damage may apply the effects in either order (most likely applying the halving effect first).
2005/10/01: Half of 1 rounded down is 0. A source that would deal 1 damage won't deal damage at all.
2005/10/01: Multiple <Ghosts of the Innocent> effects are cumulative, and each will halve the damage, rounded down. For example, with three on the battlefield, 14 damage becomes 7, then 3, then finally 1, and only 1 damage would actually be dealt.
2005/10/01: This isn't a damage prevention effect. If Excruciator ("Damage that would be dealt by Excruciator can't be prevented") would deal 7 damage to a permanent or player, it deals 3 damage instead.
2005/10/01: If damage is redirected, it's only halved once.
2005/10/01: If both <Ghosts of the Innocent> and Furnace of Rath (which doubles damage) are on the battlefield, the controller of the permanent being dealt damage or the player being dealt damage can apply the effects in either order. This can matter if the original amount of damage is odd. For example, if a source would deal 3 damage, <Ghosts of the Innocent> would make it 1 damage, then Furnace of Rath would make it 2 damage, if the player chose to apply the effects in that order.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>88985</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<CardText>Each player shuffles all permanents they own into their library, then reveals that many cards from the top of their library.

<Artist>Ron Spencer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>89084</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/10/15: Anything that triggers during the resolution of this will wait to be put on the stack until everything is put onto the battlefield and resolution is complete. The player whose turn it is will put all of their triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
2009/10/01: Taking it slowly, here's what happens when <Warp World> resolves: 1) Each player counts the number of permanents they own. 2) Each player shuffles those permanents into their library. 3) Each player reveals cards from the top of their library equal to the number that player counted. 4) Each player puts all artifact, land, and creature cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. All of these cards enter the battlefield at the same time. 5) Each player puts all enchantment cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way can enchant an artifact, land, or creature that was already put onto the battlefield, but can't enchant an enchantment that's being put onto the battlefield at the same time as it. If multiple players have Auras to put onto the battlefield, the player whose turn it is announces what their Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all enchantments (both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time. 6) Each player puts all of their other revealed cards (instants, sorceries, planeswalkers, and Auras that can't enchant anything) on the bottom of their library in any order.
2009/10/01: Tokens are permanents but not cards. They'll count toward the number of permanents shuffled into your library, so you'll get a card back for each token you owned. But the tokens themselves should be ignored while you're revealing *cards* from your library. In practice, you shouldn't actually shuffle them into your library since they'll cease to exist as soon as <Warp World> finishes resolving. Note that a token's owner is the player under whose control it first entered the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast <Chord of Calling> (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2005/10/01: <Doubling Season> affects cards that "enter the battlefield with" a certain number of counters. Triskelion, for example, would enter the battlefield with six +1/+1 counters on it rather than three.
2005/10/01: If there are two <Doubling Season>s on the battlefield, then the number of tokens or counters is four times the original number. If there are three on the battlefield, then the number of tokens or counters is eight times the original number, and so on.
2005/10/01: Planeswalkers will enter the battlefield with double the normal amount of loyalty counters. However, if you activate an ability whose cost has you put loyalty counters on a planeswalker, the number you put on isn't doubled.

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number.
