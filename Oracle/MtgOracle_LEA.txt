<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

You don't lose the game for having 0 or less life.

When Lich is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you lose the game.</CardText>
<Artist>Daniel Gelon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>69</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you have multiple <Lich> cards on the battlefield, you must sacrifice a permanent for each damage done to you for each <Lich>. This is because the sacrifice is a triggered ability. But you only draw one card for each life gained regardless of how many <Lich>es you have. This is because the draw is a replacement effect and not a triggered one. You lose if any one of the <Lich>es leaves the battlefield.
2004/10/04: If you take more than one damage at a time, sacrifice the permanents for that damage simultaneously. This allows you to sacrifice both a creature and any Aura that is on it all at once.
2004/10/04: You can't pay life, just like any player at less than one life can't pay life. You can pay zero life if you want.
2004/10/04: If an opponent steals control of <Lich> and no other effect prevents you from losing with a life total of zero, you will lose the game due to a zero life total as a State-Based Action before you can take any actions. The last sentence doesn't apply in this case since the <Lich> didn't leave the battlefield.
2004/10/04: If an opponent steals control of <Lich>, their life total does not change. The life total changes for a player only when it enters the battlefield under that player's control.
2004/10/04: You can lose life and take damage, and thereby have a negative life total, while <Lich> is on the battlefield.
2010/08/15: The last ability will cause you to lose the game even if you somehow manage to have a life total greater than 0 at the time the <Lich> leaves the battlefield or if some other effect would prevent you from losing for having 0 life. If, on the other hand, some effect such as that from Platinum Angel says that you can't lose the game then even the last ability of the <Lich> cannot cause you to do so. The ability will just resolve and the game will continue as normal.
2010/08/15: Note that usually you will have 0 or less life at the time <Lich> leaves the battlefield causing you to lose as a State-Based Action before the last ability can even go on the stack.
2011/01/01: The last ability will cause you to lose the game even if you somehow manage to have a life total greater than 0 at the time the <Lich> is put into the graveyard or if some other effect would prevent you from losing for having 0 life. If, on the other hand, some effect such as that from Platinum Angel says that you can't lose the game then even the last ability of the <Lich> cannot cause you to do so.

2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

<CardText>Look at target opponent's hand and choose a card from it. You control that player until Word of Command finishes resolving. The player plays that card if able. While doing so, the player can activate mana abilities only if they're from lands that player controls and only if mana they produce is spent to activate other mana abilities of lands the player controls and/or to play that card. If the chosen card is cast as a spell, you control the player while that spell is resolving.</CardText>
<Artist>Jesper Myrfors</Artist>
<Multiverseid>92</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: To "play a card" is to either cast a spell or to put a land onto the battlefield using the main phase special action.
2009/10/01: You do get to choose which lands get tapped. You can make them choose an optional mana generating ability of the land that they tap, such as making them tap and sacrifice the land instead of just tap it.
2011/01/01: <Word of Command> can't be used to force a player to play a card that isn't in their hand.
2011/01/01: You control the player while this spell is resolving, which means you get to see anything they can see. If that player is required to search their library as part of playing the card or as part of its resolution if it's cast as a spell, then you can see the cards in that player's library as well.
2011/01/01: Your opponent can't counter the <Word of Command> after letting you look at their hand, but they can attempt to counter the spell you force them to cast.
2011/01/01: You may Command your opponent to play a land (if they have not already done so this turn).
2011/01/01: You must order your opponent to play the chosen card if it is possible to do so.
2011/01/01: If there is a non-mana way to cast a spell, as with Pitch Spells, you may require that way to be used if it is possible to do so.
2011/01/01: Since this spell is an instant, your opponent gets a chance to respond to it as normal. Once this spell resolves, you look at your opponent's hand and choose a card. Note that it is common practice to respond to <Word of Command> by using up any spells or mana you have prior to letting it resolve.
2011/01/01: During the resolution of this spell, that player plays the chosen card.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.

2004/10/04: You can't change proper nouns (i.e. card names) such as "Island Fish Jasconius".
2004/10/04: Changing the text of a spell will not allow you to change the targets of the spell because the targets were chosen when the spell was cast. The text change will (probably) cause it to be countered since the targets will be illegal.

2004/12/01: If a Doppelganger is flipped, and it copies a flip card in any state, it will copy both "sides" of that card but use the flipped side. If a Doppelganger is unflipped, and it copies a flip card in any state, it will copy both "sides" of that card but use the unflipped side.

2007/09/16: <Vesuvan Doppelganger> copies the mana cost of the creature it's copying but doesn't copy its color.
2007/09/16: If another creature copies <Vesuvan Doppelganger>, the new creature will become a copy of whatever <Vesuvan Doppelganger> is copying except for its color, will copy <Vesuvan Doppelganger>'s color, and will gain <Vesuvan Doppelganger>'s triggered ability.
2007/09/16: <Vesuvan Doppelganger>'s triggered ability may cause it to become a copy of itself. A <Vesuvan Doppelganger> that becomes a copy of a <Vesuvan Doppelganger> (either itself or a different one) will gain another instance of its triggered ability. Each instance of that ability will trigger during its controller's upkeep. They'll all be put on the stack and resolve one at a time. The last one to resolve determines the Doppelganger's characteristics for the rest of the turn.
2007/09/16: <Vesuvan Doppelganger> copies a face-down creature, it becomes a face-up 2/2 blue creature with no name and no abilities other than the one it gives itself.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: When a spell with additional costs is copied, you don't have to pay those costs again.

2004/10/04: <Fork>ing a spell with an X in the cost requires you to use the same X value.
2004/10/04: <Fork> will not copy changes made by modifying effects to the spell prior to the use of <Fork>, such as text-changing effects.
2004/10/04: If mana or other costs need to be spent at resolution of the spell, the player of <Fork> would still be responsible for paying that cost.
2004/10/04: You need not (and may not) pay any additional mana or other costs (like sacrifices) to use the spell which is <Fork>ed. You get control over a complete copy but can change nothing except the targets.
2004/10/04: <Fork> does not let you make non-targeting choices about the spell.
2004/10/04: If the spell being copied targets a spell on the stack, it is possible to target <Fork> itself since <Fork> is still on the stack when you pick the target(s) for the copy. Note that the copy's target will be illegal when it resolves.
2004/10/04: If you copy a spell for which Buyback has been paid, you get nothing back since the copied spell does not have a card to give you.
2004/10/04: The copy that is placed on the stack is not considered to have been "cast".
2004/10/04: The <Fork> card goes to the graveyard when it resolves and leaves the copy on the stack. There is no card representing the copy on the stack.
2004/10/04: It does copy the mana symbols in the mana cost for the card it is copying, but it uses its own color definition and not the one from those mana symbols. This is so it maintains its color just like the text says.
2004/12/01: If you <Fork> a Spliced spell, the spliced text is added during the announcement of the original spell, and therefore is fully copied by <Fork>.
2009/05/01: The copy will have the same mana cost as the original spell, but will be red rather than whatever color that mana cost would have made it.
2009/10/01: If the targeted spell was kicked, then the copy will be kicked as well. If the targeted spell was not kicked, then the copy will not be kicked.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the land produces more than one color of mana at a single time, its controller chooses which of those types is produced by <Mana Flare>'s ability.
2004/10/04: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2004/10/04: When used with lands that can produce multiple colors, <Mana Flare> produces one additional mana of the same color that was produced. It can't give a mana of a color that wasn't produced.
2004/10/04: Only produces extra mana when land is tapped for mana, not when tapped by some other effect.
2004/10/04: <Mana Flare> adds one of whatever color the land produces after applying any land type or color changing effects.
2004/10/04: This is a triggered mana ability.
2007/09/16: Does not copy any restrictions on the mana, such as with Mishra's Workshop or Pillar of the Paruns.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This card has a triggered ability that causes a separate effect for 1 point of damage each time a land is tapped for mana.
2009/10/01: This ability is not a mana ability. It goes on the stack and can be responded to.
2009/10/01: The ability will trigger each time a land is tapped for mana. Each ability is separate.
2009/10/01: If any lands are tapped for mana while a player is casting a spell or activating an ability, <Manabarbs>'s ability will trigger that many times and wait. When the player finishes casting that spell or activating that ability, it's put on the stack, then <Manabarbs>'s triggered abilities are put on the stack on top of it. The <Manabarbs> abilities will resolve first.
2009/10/01: On the other hand, a player can tap lands for mana, let the <Manabarbs> triggered abilities be put on the stack, and then respond to those abilities by casting an instant or activating an ability using that mana. In that case, the spell or ability will resolve first.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>234</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: <Chaos Orb> can only affect permanents. Cards that are in the game but not on the battlefield, such as those in the Library and Graveyard, can't be affected.
2004/10/04: You can arrange your cards any time before the Orb is put onto the battlefield, but not after. In general, you should not stack cards or put them in places where your opponent can't read the names of all of them or count them. This is recommended good gaming practice.
2004/10/04: It must flip 360 degrees (that's what "flip" means). And this flip must be in the air and not in your hand.

The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band.

<CardText>{X}: You may choose a creature card in your hand whose mana cost could be paid by some amount of, or all of, the mana you spent on {X}. If you do, you may cast that card face down as a 2/2 creature spell without paying its mana cost. If the creature that spell becomes as it resolves has not been turned face up and would assign or deal damage, be dealt damage, or become tapped, instead it's turned face up and assigns or deals damage, is dealt damage, or becomes tapped. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.</CardText>
<Artist>Amy Weber</Artist>
<Multiverseid>20</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The creature enters the battlefield face down, so none of its "enters the battlefield" abilities will trigger or have any effect. Also none of its "As this enters the battlefield" abilities apply.
2004/10/04: The creature's "enters the battlefield" abilities (and any other abilities relating to the creature entering the battlefield) do not trigger when it turns face up.
2004/10/04: Only the controller of the face down creature can look at it.
2009/10/01: If you use the ability to cast a creature card face down, you must keep track of the amount and types of mana you spent on {X}. If that creature spell is moved from the stack to anywhere other than the battlefield, the resulting creature leaves the battlefield, or the game ends, the face-down card is revealed. If its mana cost couldn't be paid by some amount of, or all of, the mana you spent on {X}, all applicable penalties for casting a card illegally are assessed.
2009/10/01: You actually cast the card face-down, much as when playing a spell with Morph. It can be responded to and countered.
2009/10/01: The effect that turns it face-up is a replacement effect. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2009/10/01: You may not turn a face-down spell face up. You may not turn a face-down permanent face up unless it would have morph while face up or an effect specifically allows you to turn it face up. <Illusionary Mask>'s ability has you turn a face-down creature face up if it would assign damage, deal damage, be dealt damage, or become tapped, but not for any other reason. For example, if you use <Illusionary Mask>'s ability to cast a black creature face down, you can't turn it face up just because it's being targeted by Terror.
2009/10/01: Both the amount and types of mana you spend on {X} are taken into account while you're choosing a creature card from your hand. For example, if you spent {U}{U} on {X}, you can choose a creature card with mana cost {U}{U}, {1}{U}, {2}, or {W/U}{W/U}, among other possibilities, but not one that costs {2}{U} or one that costs {G}.
2009/10/01: While the creature card is face down, it's a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, color, creature type, abilities, or expansion symbol. Since it has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0.
2009/10/01: You may look at a face-down spell or permanent you control at any time.
2009/10/01: You can turn a face-down permanent face up if it would have morph while face up. This applies to creatures you cast face down as a result of <Illusionary Mask>'s effect. The rest of <Illusionary Mask>'s effect applies to it as well.
2009/10/01: <Illusionary Mask>'s ability will continue to apply to creatures cast face down with it, even if <Illusionary Mask> has left the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: It can only make itself into a creature during combat phases and therefore it is difficult to get Auras placed on it.
2005/08/01: A delayed triggered ability that refers to <Jade Statue> still affects it even if it's no longer a creature. For example, if <Jade Statue> blocks the Kashi-Tribe Warriors ("Whenever Kashi-Tribe Warriors deals combat damage to a creature, tap that creature and it doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step."), the Warriors' effect stops <Jade Statue> from untapping.
2005/08/01: If <Jade Statue>'s ability has been activated, abilities that trigger "at end of combat" will see <Jade Statue> as an artifact creature.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2013/09/20: If <Jade Statue> is animated by some other effect, you get an artifact creature with whatever power, toughness, and creature types (if any) are specified by that effect. If you subsequently use <Jade Statue>'s ability during combat, it will become 3/6 and gain the creature type Golem in addition to those creature types until end of combat.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This effect has no effect on the cards being put into the graveyard from a library, because they are not "discarded".
2004/10/04: You can't use the <Library of Leng> ability to place a discarded card on top of your library when you discard a card as a cost, because costs aren't effects.
2004/10/04: The discard triggers anything else that triggers on discards.
2004/10/04: You can look at a randomly discarded card before deciding where it goes.
2004/10/04: The ability applies any time a spell or ability has you discard as part of its effect. It does not matter if you or your opponent control the spell or ability. The discard is forced because it is an effect.
2004/10/04: If more than one card is discarded due to a single effect, the Library allows you to decide whether or not to use it on each of the cards. You get to decide the order the cards are placed on the library if more than one goes there.
2004/10/04: Since the card goes directly to the library, the card is not revealed unless the spell or ability requiring the discard specifically says it is.
2004/10/04: The ability replaces the normal discard action with a discard action that puts the card on the library instead of the graveyard.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put <Library of Leng> onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>
