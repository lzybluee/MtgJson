When you cast this spell, creatures you control get +2/+2 and gain trample until end of turn.
Trample, haste</CardText>
<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: The set of creatures affected by the triggered ability is determined as the ability resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +2/+2 or trample.
2016/07/13: The triggered ability resolves before <Decimator of the Provinces> enters the battlefield, so it won't get +2/+2 from its own triggered ability.
2016/07/13: A "when you cast" triggered ability resolves before the original spell resolves. It resolves even if the original spell is countered, and the original spell resolves even if the triggered ability is countered.
2016/07/13: Each card with emerge is colorless and has an emerge cost that includes one or more colors of mana. These cards are still colorless if you pay the emerge cost.
2016/07/13: A creature's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner (unless that creature is the back face of a double-faced card, is a melded permanent, or is copying something else; see below). If the mana cost includes {X}, X is considered to be 0. If it's a single-faced card with no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's an animated land, for example), its converted mana cost is 0. Ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) that were paid as the creature was cast.
2016/07/13: Colored mana components of emerge costs can't be reduced with emerge.
2016/07/13: You may sacrifice a creature with a converted mana cost of 0, such as a token creature that's not a copy of another permanent, to cast a spell for its emerge cost. You'll just pay the full emerge cost with no reduction.
2016/07/13: You may sacrifice a creature with converted mana cost greater than or equal to the emerge cost. If you do, you'll pay only the colored mana component of the emerge cost.
2016/07/13: If you sacrifice a creature with {X} in its mana cost, that X is considered to be 0.
2016/07/13: The converted mana cost of the back face of a double-faced card is the converted mana cost of its front face. The converted mana cost of a melded permanent is the sum of the converted mana costs of its front faces. A creature that's a copy of either has a converted mana cost of 0.
2016/07/13: The converted mana cost of a creature spell with emerge isn't affected by whether its emerge cost is paid. For example, if you cast Elder Deep-Fiend for its emerge cost and sacrifice a creature whose converted mana cost is 3, Elder Deep-Fiend's converted mana cost remains 8.
2016/07/13: The creature chosen to be sacrificed is still on the battlefield up through the time that you activate mana abilities. Its abilities may affect the spell's cost, be activated to generate mana, and so on. However, if it has an ability that triggers when a spell is cast, it will have been sacrificed before that ability can trigger.
2016/07/13: Once you begin to cast a spell with emerge, no player may take actions until you're done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the creature you wish to sacrifice.</Rulings>

When you cast this spell, you gain control of target opponent during that player's next turn. After that turn, that player takes an extra turn.
Flying, trample, protection from instants</CardText>
<Flavor>An enigma as vexing as life itself.</Flavor>
<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: You only control the player. You don't control any of that player's permanents, spells, or abilities.
2016/07/13: The card types that could appear in your graveyard are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted. The maximum discount that Emrakul's own ability can provide is {8}.
2016/07/13: Protection from instants means that Emrakul can't be the target of instant spells or activated or triggered abilities from instant cards, and damage that would be dealt to it by instant spells or cards is prevented. Instant spells may still affect it in other ways; for example, it would still receive the bonus from Borrowed Grace.
2016/07/13: Protection abilities only apply while the object with the ability is on the battlefield. Notably, Emrakul may be the target of a spell that targets it while on the stack, such as Convolute.
2016/07/13: The player you're controlling is still the active player during that turn.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you also continue to make your own choices and decisions.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you make all choices and decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. This includes choices about what spells to cast or what abilities to activate, as well as any decisions called for by triggered abilities or for any other reason.
2016/07/13: You can't make the affected player concede. That player may choose to concede at any time, even while you're controlling that player.
2016/07/13: You can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices—you can't do anything that player couldn't do. You can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the affected player would normally make (such as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. In other words, if the affected player wouldn't make a decision, you wouldn't make that decision on that player's behalf.
2016/07/13: You also can't make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2016/07/13: You can use only the affected player's resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; you can't use your own. Similarly, you can use the affected player's resources only to pay that player's costs; you can't spend them on your costs.
2016/07/13: If the targeted player skips their next turn, you'll control the next turn the affected player actually takes, and the extra turn the player takes will be after that turn.
2016/07/13: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works. If multiple players have cast Emrakul and targeted the same player, each ability's effect will create an extra turn.
2016/07/13: If the targeted player loses the game while you control their turn during a multiplayer game, no extra turn is created.
2016/07/13: In a Two-Headed Giant game, gaining control of a player causes you to gain control of each player on that team.
2016/07/13: A "when you cast" triggered ability resolves before the original spell resolves. It resolves even if the original spell is countered, and the original spell resolves even if the triggered ability is countered.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

2016/07/13: If you choose the first and third modes, and destroying the creature ends an "exile until" effect (such as that of Lunarch Inquisitors), the creature will return to the battlefield before you put +1/+1 counters on creatures. The same is true if you choose the second and third modes and destroying the enchantment ends such an effect.
2016/07/13: You choose all of your modes at once. You can't wait to perform one mode's actions and then decide to choose more modes.
2016/07/13: You can't choose any one mode multiple times.

2016/07/13: If one target of an escalate spell becomes illegal, the other targets will still be affected. If all of the targets become illegal, the spell won't resolve.
2016/07/13: Effects that reduce the cost of spells reduce the total cost, including any escalate costs added.
2016/07/13: If an effect allows you to cast a spell that has escalate without paying its mana cost, you pay escalate costs for that spell if you choose more than one mode.

<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: For a player's life total to become 26, the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is 4 when <Providence> resolves, it will cause you to gain 22 life; alternatively, if your life total is 40 when it resolves, it will cause you to lose 14 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2016/07/13: Your "opening hand" is the hand of cards you decide to start the game with after taking any mulligans.
2016/07/13: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans and "scryed" if applicable. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. Then the first turn begins.
2016/07/13: Revealing multiples of <Providence> from your opening hand won't cause your life total to become 32 or any number other than 26.
2016/07/13: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Providence> causes the team's life total to become 26, but only you actually gain or lose life. (Each team's starting life total in a Two-Headed Giant game is normally 30.)</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever Identity Thief attacks, you may exile another target nontoken creature. If you do, Identity Thief becomes a copy of that creature until end of turn. Return the exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: If the targeted creature has an ability that triggers when it attacks, it'll be too late for it to trigger once <Identity Thief> has that ability. The same is true if another object has an ability that triggers when a creature with certain characteristics attacks and <Identity Thief> doesn't have those characteristics until after it becomes a copy.
2016/07/13: <Identity Thief> copies the printed values of the targeted creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to that creature. It won't copy other effects that have changed the targeted creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. It also won't copy counters on the targeted creature.
2016/07/13: If the targeted creature is a double-faced or melded permanent, <Identity Thief> copies the face shown. Because <Identity Thief> is not a double-faced card or meld card, it won't be able to transform or meld. If it copies a melded permanent or the back face of a double-faced card, its converted mana cost will be 0. Exiled double-faced cards and exiled meld cards will return with their front faces up.
2016/07/13: If the targeted creature is itself copying a permanent, <Identity Thief> will become whatever it's copying, as modified by that copy effect. For example, if you target a Hamlet Captain that has become a copy of Permeating Mass, <Identity Thief> will become a Permeating Mass.
2016/07/13: This effect can cause <Identity Thief> to stop being a creature. For example, if you target an animated Gideon Jura (a planeswalker with a loyalty ability that turns him into a creature), only the printed wording will be copied; the "becomes a creature" effect won't. <Identity Thief> will become a noncreature Gideon with no loyalty, be removed from combat, and then be put into its owner's graveyard.
2016/07/13: This effect can cause <Identity Thief> to become a copy of a creature that can't normally attack, such as Lupine Prototype or a creature with defender. In these cases, it remains attacking.
2016/07/13: Noncopy effects that have already applied to <Identity Thief> will continue to apply to it. For example, if Woodcutter's Grit gave <Identity Thief> +3/+3 and hexproof earlier in the turn, <Identity Thief> will still have those bonuses after copying a creature.
2016/07/13: <Identity Thief> will still be a copy of the creature during the next end step when the exiled card returns. If it has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger for <Identity Thief> and not for the returned creature.
2016/07/13: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</Rulings>

2016/07/13: If the enchanted permanent is a land and has land types, it retains those types even though it loses any intrinsic mana abilities associated with them. For example, a Plains enchanted by <Imprisoned in the Moon> is still a Plains, but it can't tap for {W}, only for {C}.
2016/07/13: If you remove <Imprisoned in the Moon> from a planeswalker after tapping it for mana, you can still activate a loyalty ability of that planeswalker even though it's tapped.
2016/07/13: Becoming a land may cause other Auras to become illegally attached. These are put into their owner's graveyard, and any Equipment attached to the land become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Counters on the land remain on it even if they don't do anything.</Rulings>

If you really just want to cast a spell, you can even cast it with X as 0 without a target creature and have neither effect do anything.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jung Park</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: If <Tree of Perdition> isn't on the battlefield when the ability resolves, the exchange can't happen and the ability will have no effect. Notably, activating the ability and giving <Tree of Perdition> -13/-13 in response won't cause your opponent to lose the game.
2016/07/13: When the ability resolves, <Tree of Perdition>'s toughness becomes the targeted opponent's former life total and that player gains or loses an amount of life necessary so that their life total equals <Tree of Perdition>'s former toughness. Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2016/07/13: Any toughness-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will apply after its toughness is set to the player's former life total. For example, say <Tree of Perdition> is equipped with Cultist's Staff (which makes it 2/15) and the player's life total is 7. After the exchange, <Tree of Perdition> would be a 2/9 creature (its toughness became 7, which was then modified by Cultist's Staff) and the player's life total would be 15.</Rulings>

Whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Mirrorwing Dragon, that player copies that spell for each other creature they control that the spell could target. Each copy targets a different one of those creatures.</CardText>
<Artist>Min Yum</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: The copies are only created targeting creatures that the spell's controller controls. Copies are not created for all creatures on the battlefield, and the affected creatures may be controlled by a different player than the controller of <Mirrorwing Dragon>. Notably, if you cast Murder targeting your opponent's <Mirrorwing Dragon>, your creatures will each get a Murder, not your opponent's.
2016/07/13: The ability triggers whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell that targets only <Mirrorwing Dragon> and no other object or player.
2016/07/13: If a player casts an instant or sorcery spell that has multiple targets and <Mirrorwing Dragon> is chosen as the target in each instance, <Mirrorwing Dragon>'s ability will trigger. Each of the copies will similarly be targeting only one of the player's other creatures.
2016/07/13: Any creature the player controls that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by <Mirrorwing Dragon>'s ability. If the spell has multiple targets, a given creature must be a legal target for all of them or else a copy won't be created for that creature.
2016/07/13: The player who cast the original spell controls all the copies. That player chooses the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and will resolve last.
2016/07/13: The copies that the ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Mirrorwing Dragon>'s ability itself) won't trigger.
2016/07/13: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
2016/07/13: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Burn from Within does), the copies have the same value of X.
2016/07/13: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/07/13: Sacrificing a creature is part of <Eldritch Evolution>'s cost. You can't sacrifice more creatures to search for more creature cards, and you can't cast <Eldritch Evolution> at all if you control no creatures.
2016/07/13: Once you begin to cast <Eldritch Evolution>, no player may take actions until you're done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the creature you wish to sacrifice.
2016/07/13: A creature's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner (unless that creature is the back face of a double-faced card, a melded card, or is copying something else; see below). If the mana cost includes {X}, X is considered to be 0. If it's a single-faced card with no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's an animated land, for example), its converted mana cost is 0. Ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the creature was cast.
2016/07/13: A token that isn't a copy of another permanent has a converted mana cost of 0. A token that is a copy or a creature that has become a copy of another permanent has the converted mana cost of what it's copying.
2016/07/13: The converted mana cost of a permanent that's a double-faced card with its back face up is the converted mana cost of its front face. The converted mana cost of a melded permanent is the sum of the converted mana costs of its front faces. A creature that's a copy of either has a converted mana cost of 0.
2016/07/13: If a card in a library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0. If you find such a card this way, you won't have an opportunity to spend mana on {X}.</Rulings>

2016/07/13: A creature with 3 or more damage marked on it that becomes a copy of <Permeating Mass> will be destroyed immediately after becoming a copy.
2016/07/13: The damaged creature copies the printed values of <Permeating Mass>. It won't copy counters on <Permeating Mass> or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, this means that a creature that becomes a copy of <Permeating Mass> has the ability to permeate other creatures as well.

Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.

<Rulings>2016/07/13: When you activate <Geier Reach Sanitarium>'s last ability, first each player draws a card. Then the player whose turn it is selects a card from their hand and sets it aside without revealing it; proceeding in turn order, each other player does the same. Then the cards that were set aside are discarded at once.
2016/07/13: If more than one player discards a card with madness simultaneously, the player whose turn it is puts their madness abilities onto the stack first, then each other player does the same in turn order. The last one put onto the stack resolves first, and a spell cast this way will resolve before resolving the next madness ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/07/13: You choose which opponent or planeswalker controlled by an opponent each token is attacking as it enters the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same opponent or planeswalker that the trigger's source is attacking, and the tokens don't both have to attack the same player or planeswalker.
2016/07/13: On the turn they enter the battlefield, the tokens are never declared as attacking creatures. They simply enter the battlefield attacking. They won't cause any abilities that trigger "whenever a creature attacks" to trigger.
2016/07/13: If another ability of a source you control triggers when attackers are declared, such as that of Hamlet Captain, you may have it resolve before or after that of Hanweir, the Writhing Township. If that ability has targets, it won't be able to target the tokens.
