<Multiverseid>240120</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: If a spell or activated ability has a cost that requires a player to pay life (as Griselbrand's activated ability does) or sacrifice a creature (as Fling does), that spell or ability can't be cast or activated.
2012/05/01: Other things may still cause players to pay life or sacrifice creatures, such as a resolving spell or ability.
2012/05/01: <Angel of Jubilation>'s last ability doesn't look for specific words on other cards. Rather, it stops players from taking specific actions. For example, you couldn't activate an ability with an activation of cost of "Sacrifice an artifact:" by sacrificing an artifact creature (although you could sacrifice a noncreature artifact).</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>240072</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: <Divine Deflection>'s only target is the permanent or player it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you cast <Divine Deflection>, not at the time it prevents damage.
2012/05/01: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time <Divine Deflection> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. No damage will be prevented.
2012/05/01: <Divine Deflection> can prevent damage that would be dealt to you, one or more creatures you control, and/or one or more planeswalkers you control.
2012/05/01: <Divine Deflection> can prevent damage from multiple sources dealing damage simultaneously (such as during combat). If the chosen value for X won't prevent all the damage, you choose which sources to prevent damage from.
2012/05/01: If damage is dealt to multiple permanents you control, or is dealt to you and at least one permanent you control, you choose which of that damage to prevent if the chosen value for X won't prevent all the damage. For example, if 3 damage would be dealt to you and to each of two creatures you control, and <Divine Deflection> will prevent the next 3 damage, you might choose to prevent the next 2 damage it would deal to you and the next 1 damage it would deal to one of the creatures, among other choices. You don't decide until the point at which the damage would be dealt.
2012/05/01: <Divine Deflection>'s effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, <Divine Deflection> (not the original source) deals damage to the targeted permanent or player as part of that prevention effect. <Divine Deflection> is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
2012/05/01: If <Divine Deflection> prevents damage, excess damage (if any) dealt by that source is dealt at the same time. Immediately afterward, as part of that same prevention effect, <Divine Deflection> deals its damage. This happens before state-based actions are checked, and before the spell or ability that caused damage to be dealt resumes its resolution.
2012/05/01: Whether the targeted permanent or player is still a legal target is not checked after <Divine Deflection> resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by <Divine Deflection> gains shroud after <Divine Deflection> resolves, <Divine Deflection> can still deal damage to that creature.
2012/05/01: If <Divine Deflection> can't deal damage to the targeted permanent or player (because the creature is no longer on the battlefield, or is no longer a creature, or the player is no longer in the game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won't deal any damage itself.</Rulings>

Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.

When Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a creature, each other nontoken creature you control becomes a copy of that creature.
Nontoken creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of enchanted creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Multiverseid>271117</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: <Infinite Reflection> can enchant a creature controlled by another player.
2012/05/01: If <Infinite Reflection> enters the battlefield attached to a creature and then becomes attached to a different creature before its enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, each other nontoken creature you control will become a copy of the first creature.
2012/05/01: If <Infinite Reflection> leaves the battlefield or becomes attached to a different creature, none of the copy effects end. Your creatures will still be copies of whatever creature each was a copy of.
2012/05/01: If <Infinite Reflection> enters the battlefield attached to a token creature, the nontoken creatures that become copies of that creature are not themselves tokens.
2012/05/01: Creatures you control don't copy whether the enchanted creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2012/05/01: Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of the enchanted creature, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger. However, if the enchanted creature has any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities, those will trigger.
2012/05/01: Replacement effects that modify how a permanent enters the battlefield are now applied in the following order: control-changing effects (such as Gather Specimens), then copy effects (such as the abilities of <Infinite Reflection> and Clone), then all other effects.
2012/05/01: If a creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and <Infinite Reflection>'s. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of the enchanted creature when it enters the battlefield.
2012/05/01: Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be a copy of the enchanted creature at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, if the enchanted creature is Serra Angel, a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of Serra Angel, and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as a copy of Serra Angel with no counters.
2012/05/01: External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls Urabrask the Hidden, which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped copy of the enchanted creature.
2012/05/01: If you control more than one <Infinite Reflection>, you can apply those copy effects in any order. Creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.</Rulings>

<Artist>Johannes Voss</Artist>
<Multiverseid>240153</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: <Dark Impostor> gains only activated abilities. It doesn't gain triggered abilities or static abilities. Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities; they have colons in their reminder text.
2012/05/01: If an activated ability of a card in exile references the card it's printed on by name, treat <Dark Impostor>'s version of that ability as though it referenced <Dark Impostor> by name instead. For example, if Marrow Bats (which says "Pay 4 life: Regenerate Marrow Bats") is exiled with <Dark Impostor>, <Dark Impostor> has the ability "Pay 4 life: Regenerate <Dark Impostor>."
2012/05/01: <Dark Impostor> can target and exile a permanent that's only a creature temporarily, like an animated land. However, because that card isn't a creature card, <Dark Impostor> won't have any of that card's activated abilities.
2012/05/01: If you control more than one <Dark Impostor>, each will have only the activated abilities of creature cards exiled with that specific <Dark Impostor>.
2012/05/01: Once <Dark Impostor> leaves the battlefield, it will no longer have the activated abilities of the creature cards exiled with it. If it returns to the battlefield, it will be a new <Dark Impostor> with no connection to those exiled cards.</Rulings>

For example, if the ability triggers, then you lose control of your one creature before it resolves, you can cast a creature with flash to make sure you control exactly one creature when the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Johannes Voss</Artist>
<Multiverseid>240138</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: The ability granted by <Dual Casting> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2012/05/01: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/05/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/05/01: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
2012/05/01: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/05/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling and then copy it with the ability granted by <Dual Casting>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control simultaneously, divide the original amount and double the results. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.</Rulings>

If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent (as Brain Gorger's ability does), you can't take that option.
2012/05/01: If a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to perform an action unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Ogre Marauder does), you can't choose to sacrifice a permanent. You must perform the action. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does), you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since you can't sacrifice any permanents.
2012/05/01: You may still sacrifice permanents to pay the costs of spells you cast and abilities you activate, or because a resolving spell or ability you control instructs or allows you to do so.
2012/05/01: You may sacrifice a permanent to pay the activation cost of an ability, even if that ability comes from a permanent an opponent controls (such as Excavation).
2012/05/01: You may sacrifice a permanent as a special action, even if the effect that allows you to do so comes from an opponent's permanent (such as Damping Engine or Volrath's Curse). No one controls special actions.
2012/05/01: This ability affects only sacrifices. It won't stop a creature from being put into the graveyard due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into the graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: If <Angel's Tomb> is already a creature when a creature enters the battlefield under your control, its ability will override any effects that set its base power and toughness to specific values, but other changes to its power and toughness (such as the one created by Titanic Growth) will still apply.
2015/06/22: Effects setting <Angel's Tomb>'s base power and toughness to specific values that begin to apply after <Angel's Tomb> has become a creature will override the effect of <Angel's Tomb>. For example, if an effect causes a 3/3 <Angel's Tomb> to become 0/1, it will remain 0/1 until another effect (such as triggering the ability of <Angel's Tomb> a second time or targeting it with Titanic Growth) causes those values to change.</Rulings>
