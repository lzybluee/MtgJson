<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Maze of Ith> can target an untapped attacking creature. It will still prevent damage in that case.
2016/06/08: The creature isn't removed from combat; it just has its damage prevented. It's still an attacking creature until the combat phase is complete.
2016/06/08: You can activate <Maze of Ith>'s ability targeting an attacking creature you control during the combat damage step or the end of combat step. It'll be untapped and the damage it had already dealt won't be undone.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: An activated ability has a "Cost: Effect" format. Look for the colon. A triggered ability starts with "when", "whenever", or "at".
2004/10/04: Turn-based actions and special actions like the normal card draw, combat damage, or turning a face-down creature face up can't be targeted.
2004/10/04: It can target delayed triggered abilities. For example, a card that says "Whenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield at the beginning of the end step." triggers when a player cycles a card and creates a delayed trigger that happens at the beginning of the end step. You can choose to target the "at the beginning of the end step" trigger when it is placed on the stack at end of turn.</Rulings>
