<CardText>Enchant creature
At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, put a -0/-1 counter on that creature.
When enchanted creature dies, that creature's controller chooses a creature that Takklemaggot could enchant. If the player does, return Takklemaggot to the battlefield under your control attached to that creature. If they don't, return Takklemaggot to the battlefield under your control as a non-Aura enchantment. It loses "enchant creature" and gains "At the beginning of that player's upkeep, Takklemaggot deals 1 damage to that player."</CardText>
<Artist>Daniel Gelon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>2815</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the creature leaves the battlefield without going to the graveyard, <Takklemaggot> is simply put into its owner's graveyard.
2008/05/01: <Takklemaggot>'s controller no longer changes as it returns to the battlefield. The player who controlled it when it left the battlefield is the same player that controls it when it returns to the battlefield, even though a different player may be choosing what it will be attached to after returning onto the battlefield.
2009/10/01: When the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard, <Takklemaggot>'s second ability triggers, then <Takklemaggot> is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. When the ability resolves, if <Takklemaggot> is still in that graveyard, it's returned to the battlefield.
2009/10/01: The player who controlled the creature that went to the graveyard (and caused <Takklemaggot>'s second ability to trigger) chooses what creature <Takklemaggot> will return to the battlefield attached to. The creature isn't chosen until the ability resolves, so no player can respond between the time the creature is chosen and the time <Takklemaggot> returns to the battlefield attached to it. The ability doesn't target a creature, so a creature with shroud, for example, can be chosen. However, only a creature that can be legally enchanted by <Takklemaggot> can be chosen, so a creature with protection from black, for example, can't be chosen. If the player can choose a creature, they must do so, no matter who controls it. If the player can't choose a creature, <Takklemaggot> returns to the battlefield as a non-Aura enchantment, and that player is the player that <Takklemaggot> will deal damage to.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christopher Rush</Artist>
<Multiverseid>2818</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: The ability grants you control of all creatures that are blocking it as the ability resolves. This will include any creatures that were put onto the battlefield blocking it.
2009/05/01: Any blocking creatures that regenerated during combat will have been removed from combat. Since such creatures are no longer in combat, they cannot be blocking <The Wretched>, which means you won't be able to gain control of them.
2009/05/01: If <The Wretched> itself regenerated during combat, then it will have been removed from combat. Since it is no longer in combat, there cannot be any creatures blocking it, which means you won't be able to gain control of any creatures.
2009/10/01: <The Wretched>'s ability triggers only if it's still on the battlefield when the end of combat step begins (after the combat damage step). For example, if it's blocked by a 7/7 creature and is destroyed, its ability won't trigger at all.
2009/10/01: If <The Wretched> leaves the battlefield, you no longer control it, so the duration of its control-change effect ends.
2009/10/01: If you lose control of <The Wretched> before its ability resolves, you won't gain control of the creatures blocking it at all.
2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the permanents you gained control of remain creatures, only that they remain on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: As you activate the ability, the targets you choose must be two artifacts, two creatures, or two lands. As the ability resolves, both targets will be legal only if they are two artifacts, two creatures, or two lands at that time as well, though they may be a different type than they were at the time the ability was activated. For example, if the targets were a creature and an artifact creature when the ability was activated, but the first target became a noncreature artifact by the time the ability resolves, both targets will still be legal (since they're both artifacts).
2009/10/01: If one of the targets is illegal by the time the ability resolves (because the wrong player controls it, or it's the wrong card type, or for any other reason), the exchange doesn't happen. The target that's still legal will remain under its controller's control. Since the exchange doesn't happen, no Auras are destroyed.

<Artist>Bryon Wackwitz</Artist>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.
2016/06/08: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.</Rulings>
