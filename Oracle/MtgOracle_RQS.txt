<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.

<Name>Battering Ram</Name>
<Type>Artifact Creature — Construct 1/1</Type>
<ManaCost>2 (2)</ManaCost>
<CardText>At the beginning of combat on your turn, Battering Ram gains banding until end of combat. (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control are being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's blocking.)
Whenever Battering Ram becomes blocked by a Wall, destroy that Wall at end of combat.</CardText>
<Flavor>By the time Mishra was defeated, no mage was foolish enough to rely heavily on walls.</Flavor>
<Artist>Jeff A. Menges</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

{X}, {T}: Put up to X +1/+0 counters on Clockwork Beast. This ability can't cause the total number of +1/+0 counters on Clockwork Beast to be greater than seven. Activate this ability only during your upkeep.</CardText>
<Artist>Drew Tucker</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: Loses a counter even if it is affected by a Fog-like effect which prevents it from dealing damage.
2004/10/04: Can attack or block even if it has no counters.
2007/09/16: This is a change from the most recent wording. Now, if some other spell or ability causes +1/+0 counters to be put on <Clockwork Beast>, it can wind up with more than seven such counters on it.
2007/09/16: If <Clockwork Beast> has seven or fewer +1/+0 counters on it when its last ability resolves, it can wind up a maximum of seven such counters on it. If it has seven or more +1/+0 counters on it, the ability will have no effect.
2007/09/16: <Clockwork Beast>'s last ability resolves, you can choose to put fewer than X +1/+0 counters on it.</Rulings>
