<Artist>Adam Rex</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.

<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager.
2008/10/01: In other words: Each turn, each player can cast any number of artifact spells plus a maximum of one nonartifact spell.
2008/10/01: This effect counts all nonartifact spells that are cast, even those that are countered.
2008/10/01: This effect takes into account spells that were cast earlier in the turn that <Ethersworn Canonist> entered the battlefield, including any spells still on the stack. However, any spells on the stack as <Ethersworn Canonist> enters the battlefield have already been cast by that point, so they're not affected by it.</Rulings>

Suspend 1—{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {R} and exile it with a time counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Michael Sutfin</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

2018/07/13: If a creature with evoke enters the battlefield without being cast, you won't have to sacrifice it.

• Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
• You gain 2 life.
Equip {2}</CardText>
<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Rulings>2005/02/01: <Umezawa's Jitte>'s activated ability generates a modal choice. The choice is made when the ability is activated.
2005/02/01: If the "target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn" mode is chosen, the target creature must also be announced.
2005/02/01: The ability can be used any time <Umezawa's Jitte>'s controller has priority — only the "target creature" choice has additional requirements. Choosing the "Equipped creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn" mode does nothing if the Jitte isn't equipped to a creature when the ability resolves.
2005/02/01: If the Jitte is moved after the "+2/+2" mode is announced but before it resolves, the bonus is given to the creature that is equipped when the ability resolves.
2005/02/01: If the Jitte leaves the battlefield after the "+2/+2" mode is announced but before it resolves, the bonus is given to the creature that was most recently equipped once the ability resolves.</Rulings>

When Willbender is turned face up, change the target of target spell or ability with a single target.</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Peterson</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The trigger occurs when you use the Morph ability to turn the card face up, or when an effect turns it face up. It will not trigger on being revealed or on leaving the battlefield.
2013/04/15: If a spell with split second is on the stack, you can still respond by turning this creature face up and targeting that spell with the trigger. This is because split second only stops players from casting spells or activating abilities, while turning a creature face up is a special action.
2018/03/16: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Willbender>'s triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.

<Rulings>2005/08/01: If another player takes control of the Factory while it is animated, that player keeps control until the control effect ends. They do not lose control just because the card stops being an Assembly-Worker. Note that Auras which steal cards will go to the graveyard if the permanent they enchant is no longer valid.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
2016/06/08: Once turned into a creature, <Mishra's Factory>'s last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.

<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>
<Artist>Anson Maddocks</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daren Bader</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Swampcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Swamp card. After you find a Swamp card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2016/06/08: Swampcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Swampcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Swampcycling from being activated.
2016/06/08: Swampcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Swampcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

2004/10/04: Remove one counter each time it would be damaged. If it was going to take more than one point of damage, you prevent all the damage and still only remove one counter.
2004/10/04: The damage prevention ability works even if it has no counters, as long as some effect keeps its toughness above zero.</Rulings>

2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>

If the creature that spell becomes as it resolves has not been turned face up and would assign or deal damage, be dealt damage, or become tapped, instead it's turned face up and assigns or deals damage, is dealt damage, or becomes tapped.

<Artist>Amy Weber</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The creature's "enters the battlefield" abilities (and any other abilities relating to the creature entering the battlefield) do not trigger when it turns face up.
2004/10/04: Only the controller of the face down creature can look at it.
2004/10/04: The creature enters the battlefield face down, so none of its "enters the battlefield" abilities will trigger or have any effect. Also none of its "As this enters the battlefield" abilities apply.
2009/10/01: <Illusionary Mask>'s ability will continue to apply to creatures cast face down with it, even if <Illusionary Mask> has left the battlefield.
2009/10/01: While the creature card is face down, it's a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, color, creature type, abilities, or expansion symbol. Since it has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0.
2009/10/01: You may look at a face-down spell or permanent you control at any time.
2009/10/01: You can turn a face-down permanent face up if it would have morph while face up. This applies to creatures you cast face down as a result of <Illusionary Mask>'s effect. The rest of <Illusionary Mask>'s effect applies to it as well.
2009/10/01: If you use the ability to cast a creature card face down, you must keep track of the amount and types of mana you spent on {X}. If that creature spell is moved from the stack to anywhere other than the battlefield, the resulting creature leaves the battlefield, or the game ends, the face-down card is revealed. If its mana cost couldn't be paid by some amount of, or all of, the mana you spent on {X}, all applicable penalties for casting a card illegally are assessed.
2009/10/01: You actually cast the card face-down, much as when playing a spell with Morph. It can be responded to and countered.
2009/10/01: The effect that turns it face-up is a replacement effect. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2009/10/01: You may not turn a face-down spell face up. You may not turn a face-down permanent face up unless it would have morph while face up or an effect specifically allows you to turn it face up. <Illusionary Mask>'s ability has you turn a face-down creature face up if it would assign damage, deal damage, be dealt damage, or become tapped, but not for any other reason. For example, if you use <Illusionary Mask>'s ability to cast a black creature face down, you can't turn it face up just because it's being targeted by Terror.
2009/10/01: Both the amount and types of mana you spend on {X} are taken into account while you're choosing a creature card from your hand.
