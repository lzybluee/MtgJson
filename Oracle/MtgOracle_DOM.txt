2018/04/27: When its activated ability resolves, Evra's power will become your former life total and you will gain or lose an amount of life such that your life total equals Evra's former power. Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2018/04/27: Any power-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will apply after Evra's power is set to your former life total. For example, say Evra is enchanted with Dub (which makes it 6/6) and your life total is 7. After the exchange, Evra would be a 9/6 creature (its power became 7, which was then modified by Dub) and your life total would be 6.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If a player somehow has only one land card in their graveyard when either of <Fall of the Thran>'s last two chapter abilities resolves, that player returns that one card to the battlefield.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daniel Ljunggren</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442926</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: <Triumph of Gerrard>'s chapter abilities each target any creature you control with the greatest power among creatures you control. If the power of another creature you control becomes greater before that ability resolves, the target is illegal.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2018/04/27: If <The Antiquities War> somehow becomes an artifact enchantment prior to resolving its final chapter ability, it will become a 5/5 Saga artifact enchantment creature, and will then be sacrificed after that ability resolves.
2018/04/27: An Equipment that becomes an artifact creature becomes unattached if it's attached to a creature. Its equip ability can be activated, but it won't become attached to the target creature.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.

<Multiverseid>442942</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: Gaining control of a permanent doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it. They'll remain attached, but an Aura's effect that affects "you" still affects its controller rather than you, the controller of an Equipment can move it during their next main phase, and so on.
2018/04/27: If you control two <In Bolas's Clutches> attached to two permanents with the same name, the "legend rule" applies to the enchanted permanents and to <In Bolas's Clutches> at once. You can choose to keep the <In Bolas's Clutches> that enchants the permanent you wish to keep.
2018/04/27: If you control two or more permanents with the same name but only one is legendary, the "legend rule" doesn't apply.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If the target player or target nonland permanent is an illegal target as <Karn's Temporal Sundering> resolves, the other target is affected as normal and <Karn's Temporal Sundering> is exiled. If both targets are illegal, <Karn's Temporal Sundering> doesn't resolve and isn't exiled.
2018/04/27: You can't cast a legendary sorcery unless you control a legendary creature or a legendary planeswalker. Once you begin to cast a legendary sorcery, losing control of your legendary creatures and planeswalkers won't affect that spell.
2018/04/27: Other than the casting restriction, the legendary supertype on a sorcery carries no additional rules. You may cast any number of legendary sorceries in a turn, and your deck may contain any number of legendary cards (but no more than four of any with the same name).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: Once you announce that you're casting a spell or activating an ability, no player may take other actions until the spell or ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to remove a permanent's activated abilities to stop them from happening. Once activated, the ability on the stack will resolve even if the creature loses the ability.
2018/04/27: If the target creature has an ability that triggers when it becomes tapped, that ability triggers before it loses all abilities.
2018/04/27: If the target creature has power and toughness written as */* with an ability that defines its power and toughness, it's 0/0 when it loses all abilities. If its power and toughness are written as */*+1, it's 0/1, and so on.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Arnold</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442945</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: <The Mirari Conjecture>'s final chapter ability copies any instant or sorcery spell you cast, not just those with targets.
2018/04/27: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2018/04/27: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/04/27: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/04/27: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Jaya's Immolating Inferno does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/04/27: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fight with Fire does when kicked), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/04/27: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<CardText>If a Wizard entering the battlefield under your control causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</CardText>
<Flavor>"Perfect. Now do it again."</Flavor>
<Artist>Ryan Alexander Lee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442946</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: Naban affects a Wizard's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that Wizard enters the battlefield. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2018/04/27: Replacement effects are unaffected by Naban's first ability. For example, a Wizard that enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.
2018/04/27: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a card name with Meddling Mage, are unaffected.
2018/04/27: Naban's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.
2018/04/27: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "Wizards." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control" would trigger twice if the entering creature is a Wizard.
2018/04/27: Look at each permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if you control Arcane Adaptation with Wizard as the chosen creature type, a Runeclaw Bear entering the battlefield will cause any abilities it triggers to trigger an additional time.
2018/04/27: If you somehow control two Nabans, a Wizard entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Naban causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
2018/04/27: If a Wizard entering the battlefield at the same time as Naban (including Naban itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2018/04/27: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.
2018/04/27: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>442947</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a Wizard you control may become lethal if Naru leaves the battlefield during that turn.
2018/04/27: Naru's triggered ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2018/04/27: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2018/04/27: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them.

<Rulings>2018/04/27: <Precognition Field> lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2018/04/27: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2018/04/27: You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of the cards you play from your library.

<Rulings>2018/04/27: A card, spell, or permanent is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make an object more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—an object either is historic or it isn't.
2018/04/27: Some abilities trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell." Such an ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/04/27: An ability that triggers "whenever you cast a historic spell" doesn't trigger if a historic card is put onto the battlefield without being cast.
2018/04/27: Lands are never cast, so abilities that trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell" won't trigger if you play a legendary land. They also won't trigger if a card on the battlefield transforms into a legendary land, as the Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan double-faced cards do.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If another effect causes the Nightmare Horror token's power or toughness to be a number other than X immediately after it enters the battlefield, the amount of damage it deals to you is still X, not its modified power or toughness.
2018/04/27: If an effect such as that of Anointed Procession causes the final chapter ability of <Chainer's Torment> to create two Nightmare Horror tokens, each will deal X damage to you.
2018/04/27: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the first chapter abilities of <Chainer's Torment> each cause the opposing team to lose 4 life and you to gain 2 life.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

For example, if an effect has given Grunn -7/-0 so that it's a -2/5 creature, doubling its power and toughness gives it -2/+5, and it's a -4/10 until end of turn.
2018/04/27: A creature attacks alone if it's the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step (including creatures controlled by your teammates, if applicable).

<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Multiverseid>443061</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2018/04/27: The token isn't legendary, and this exception is copiable. If something else copies the token later, that copy also won't be legendary. If you control two or more permanents with the same name but only one is legendary, the "legend rule" doesn't apply.
2018/04/27: The token gains haste indefinitely, and this effect isn't copiable. If something else copies the token later, that copy won't have haste.
2018/04/27: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/04/27: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created that token.
2018/04/27: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2018/04/27: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2018/04/27: If the equipped creature leaves the battlefield before the triggered ability of <Helm of the Host> resolves, or if there is no equipped creature, no token is created.

<Rulings>2018/04/27: The token will have <Mishra's Self-Replicator>'s ability. It will also be able to create copies of itself.
2018/04/27: While resolving the triggered ability of <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, you can't pay {1} multiple times to create more than one token. However, if you control more than one <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, you can pay {1} for each of their abilities.
2018/04/27: The token won't copy counters or damage marked on <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Mishra's Self-Replicator>'s power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, but if any copy effects have affected that <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, they're taken into account.
2018/04/27: If <Mishra's Self-Replicator> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the token will still enter the battlefield as a copy of <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, using <Mishra's Self-Replicator>'s copiable values from when it was last on the battlefield.
2018/04/27: A card, spell, or permanent is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make an object more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—an object either is historic or it isn't.
