<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
2008/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
2008/10/01: If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
2008/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until end of turn. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
2008/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.
2008/10/01: Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared.
2012/07/01: The creature you target with the last ability will become tapped before blockers are declared.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/07/01: A permanent card is a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card (instant and sorcery cards aren't permanent cards).

2012/07/01: If an effect sets your life total to a specific number, and that number is higher than your current life total, the effect will cause you to gain life equal to the difference. <Rhox Faithmender> will then double that number. For example, if you have 3 life and an effect says that your life total "becomes 10," your life total will actually become 17.
2012/07/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, only <Rhox Faithmender>'s controller is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, <Rhox Faithmender> will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the shared team life total.</Rulings>

2011/09/22: If Jace's third ability causes a player to draw more cards than are left in their library, that player loses the game as a state-based action. If this ability causes all players to do this, the game is a draw.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: The last ability of <Jace's Phantasm> constantly monitors each opponent's graveyard to see if the bonus applies. If the stated condition becomes no longer true, the bonus immediately stops applying.
2017/11/17: If <Jace's Phantasm> is dealt lethal damage at the same time as an opponent's creature, and that creature will become that opponent's tenth card in their graveyard, <Jace's Phantasm> will be destroyed before it gets +4/+4. This is because all creatures that have been dealt lethal damage are destroyed at the same time.
2017/11/17: In a multiplayer game, a single opponent must have ten or more cards in their graveyard for the bonus to apply, although this opponent may change over the course of the game. You don't have to pick a single opponent; the ability will monitor each opponent's graveyard.</Rulings>

2010/08/15: If you cast <Redirect> targeting a spell that targets a spell on the stack (like Cancel does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself. You can, however, change that spell's target to <Redirect>. If you do, that spell won't resolve when it tries to resolve because <Redirect> will have left the stack by then.
2010/08/15: <Redirect> can target any spell, not just an instant or sorcery spell. For example, you could use it to change the target of an Aura spell. However, if the targeted spell has no targets (for example, if it's an instant or sorcery spell that doesn't specifically use the word "target," or if it's a creature spell), <Redirect> won't have any effect on it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s first ability doesn't target the artifact. No player may take actions between the time you choose an artifact and the time you put a phylactery counter on it.
2018/07/13: If you control no artifacts as <Phylactery Lich> enters the battlefield, its first ability won't do anything. As soon as it enters the battlefield, its last ability will trigger (unless you control some other permanent with a phylactery counter on it) and you'll have to sacrifice it.
2018/07/13: If <Phylactery Lich> and an artifact are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you can't put a phylactery counter on that artifact. You must choose an artifact you control that's already on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.
2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability checks your permanents for any phylactery counters, not just the specific one that it caused you to put on an artifact. For example, if you control two <Phylactery Lich>es and two different artifacts with phylactery counters, neither <Phylactery Lich> will be sacrificed if one of those artifacts leaves the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Name>Chandra, the Firebrand</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra (Loyalty: 3)</Type>
<ManaCost>3R (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+1]: Chandra, the Firebrand deals 1 damage to any target.
[-2]: When you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
[-6]: Chandra, the Firebrand deals 6 damage to each of up to six targets.</CardText>
<Artist>D. Alexander Gregory</Artist>
<Multiverseid>259205</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Chandra's second ability creates a delayed triggered ability that will copy the next instant or sorcery spell you cast that turn, regardless of whether that spell has targets.
2011/09/22: When the delayed trigger resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2011/09/22: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2011/09/22: If the spell Chandra copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2011/09/22: If the spell Chandra copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Consume Spirit does), the copy has the same value of X.
2011/09/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling after activating Chandra's second ability, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage.
2011/09/22: When you activate Chandra's last ability, you choose up to six target creatures and/or players. No damage is divided, and Chandra can't deal more than 6 damage to any one target. Chandra deals 6 damage to each target that is still legal when the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: If you control more than one <Mogg Flunkies>, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
2018/03/16: Although <Mogg Flunkies> can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, <Mogg Flunkies> could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that <Mogg Flunkies> blocks.
2018/03/16: Once <Mogg Flunkies> has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
2018/03/16: If an effect says that <Mogg Flunkies> attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with <Mogg Flunkies> and that creature.
2018/03/16: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Mogg Flunkies> can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"Not bad, but I can think of a better use for that."</Flavor>
<Artist>jD</Artist>
<Multiverseid>290289</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Reverberate> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2010/08/15: When <Reverberate> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2010/08/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2010/08/15: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Reverberate>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2010/08/15: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2012/07/01: <Elderscale Wurm>'s last ability doesn't affect the loss or payment of life.

<Multiverseid>279717</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: Paying the activation cost of <Elixir of Immortality>'s ability doesn't cause it to leave the battlefield. If you have a way to untap it, you can activate the ability multiple times in response to itself.
2011/09/22: As the ability resolves, you'll shuffle <Elixir of Immortality> into its owner's library directly from the battlefield, if it's still there.
2011/09/22: If <Elixir of Immortality> is in your graveyard at the time the ability resolves, you'll still wind up shuffling it into your library because you shuffle your entire graveyard into your library. If it's anywhere else by that time, including in another player's graveyard, it remains where it is and you shuffle just your graveyard into your library.
2011/09/22: If you gain control of another player's <Elixir of Immortality> and activate it, the <Elixir of Immortality> will be shuffled into its owner's library and the cards in your graveyard will be shuffled into your library. You are considered to have shuffled each affected library (even if, as a shortcut, each player physically shuffles their own library).</Rulings>
