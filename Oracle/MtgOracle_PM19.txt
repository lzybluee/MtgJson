<Rulings>2018/07/13: If the cost of an ability or an additional cost of a spell requires putting counters on a creature or player affected by <Suncleanser>, that cost can't be paid.

<CardText>Enchant creature
As Metamorphic Alteration enters the battlefield, choose a creature.
Enchanted creature is a copy of the chosen creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Livia Prima</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: You can choose only a creature on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Metamorphic Alteration> copies exactly what is printed on the chosen creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it as any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2018/07/13: The characteristics that will be copied are determined as <Metamorphic Alteration>'s effect first begins to apply. If the copiable values of the chosen creature change later, or if that creature leaves the battlefield, the enchanted creature's characteristics are unaffected.
2018/07/13: If the chosen creature isn't normally a creature (for example, if the chosen creature is an animated Treetop Village), the enchanted creature becomes a copy of that noncreature permanent. This causes <Metamorphic Alteration> to be illegally attached, and it's put into its owner's graveyard. The previously enchanted creature returns to being itself.
2018/07/13: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is enchanted by another <Metamorphic Alteration>), then the enchanted creature becomes a copy of whatever the chosen creature copied.
2018/07/13: If the chosen creature is a token, <Metamorphic Alteration> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. The enchanted creature doesn't become a token in this case.
2018/07/13: The enchanted creature will be a copy of the chosen creature as it dies, so any "when this creature dies" abilities it gains from the copy effect will trigger. Any "when this creature dies" abilities it normally has will not trigger.
2018/07/13: If <Metamorphic Alteration> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't have the enchanted creature become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Metamorphic Alteration> can cause a creature to become a copy of itself. This generally has no effect, but if that creature has a pair of linked abilities, the new abilities it has from the copy effect aren't linked to the abilities it had before.
2018/07/13: The copiable values granted by <Metamorphic Alteration> are locked in as the creature is chosen. The enchanted creature won't change if the chosen creature's copiable values change.</Rulings>

<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: The amounts that are lost are rounded up, not the amounts kept. For example, a player with 5 life, five cards in hand, and five creatures would lose 3 life, discard three cards, and sacrifice three creatures.
2018/07/13: Because the instructions are followed in order, abilities of the creatures a player will sacrifice may modify or trigger on losing life, discarding cards, and/or sacrificing creatures. Abilities that trigger this way will resolve after <Fraying Omnipotence> is done resolving.
2018/07/13: When <Fraying Omnipotence> resolves, first each player loses the appropriate amount of life at once. Next, the player whose turn it is chooses an appropriate number of cards in hand without revealing them, then each other player in turn order does the same, and then those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Then, the player whose turn it is chooses an appropriate number of creatures they control. Each other player in turn order does the same, knowing choices made by previous players. Finally, all of the chosen creatures are sacrificed simultaneously.
2018/07/13: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Fraying Omnipotence> causes each player to lose half of their team's life, rounded up. This means that teams at an even life total will have 0 life, and teams at an odd life total will have -1 life. The game then ends in a draw.</Rulings>

Whenever Isareth the Awakener attacks, you may pay {X}. When you do, return target creature card with converted mana cost X from your graveyard to the battlefield with a corpse counter on it. If that creature would leave the battlefield, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Isareth's triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, you may pay {X}. When you do, a second ability triggers and you pick a target creature card to return. This is different from abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities after mana is paid and the target creature card is chosen, but before that card is returned.
2018/07/13: Because all attacking creatures are chosen at once, a creature returned this way can't attack during the same combat as it returns, even if it has haste.
2018/07/13: If a card in your graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/07/13: If you somehow remove a corpse counter from a creature Isareth has returned to the battlefield, the replacement effect that will exile it continues to apply. The counter is only to help remind you which creatures will be exiled if they would leave the battlefield.
2018/07/13: If Isareth leaves the battlefield, the replacement effect continues to apply. If one of the creatures it returned would leave the battlefield, it'll be exiled instead.
2018/07/13: Because to die means to be put into a graveyard from the battlefield, a creature that is exiled instead doesn't "die." Abilities that would trigger when it dies won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s first ability doesn't target the artifact. No player may take actions between the time you choose an artifact and the time you put a phylactery counter on it.
2018/07/13: If you control no artifacts as <Phylactery Lich> enters the battlefield, its first ability won't do anything. As soon as it enters the battlefield, its last ability will trigger (unless you control some other permanent with a phylactery counter on it) and you'll have to sacrifice it.
2018/07/13: If <Phylactery Lich> and an artifact are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you can't put a phylactery counter on that artifact. You must choose an artifact you control that's already on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.
2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability checks your permanents for any phylactery counters, not just the specific one that it caused you to put on an artifact. For example, if you control two <Phylactery Lich>es and two different artifacts with phylactery counters, neither <Phylactery Lich> will be sacrificed if one of those artifacts leaves the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Artist>Deruchenko Alexander</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Dark-Dweller Oracle> doesn't change when you can cast the exiled card. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2018/07/13: Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2018/07/13: If you don't cast the exiled card, it remains in exile.
2018/07/13: You can sacrifice <Dark-Dweller Oracle> to pay the cost for its own ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: If you cast a creature spell that will enter the battlefield with a number of +1/+1 counters, such as Hungering Hydra, those counters aren't considered when determining whether either ability of <Sarkhan's Unsealing> triggers. Similarly, effects that will raise the creature's power once it has entered the battlefield won't apply.
2018/07/13: Each of the triggered abilities of <Sarkhan's Unsealing> resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/07/13: If a creature card's power is written as * and an ability defines its power, that ability applies while the creature spell is on the stack. Sarkhan's unsealing checks its power only as you finish paying costs; it doesn't matter what the spell's power is as you begin to cast it or when the triggered ability resolves.

2018/07/13: Effects that raise or lower a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2018/07/13: If Chromium gains an ability after its activated ability resolves, it will keep that ability.
2018/07/13: Activating Chromium's last ability after it has become blocked won't cause Chromium to become unblocked.</Rulings>

<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: When Nicol Bolas's enters-the-battlefield triggered ability resolves, first the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a card in their hand without revealing it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen cards are discarded at the same time.
2018/07/13: If Nicol Bolas leaves the battlefield after his creature face's activated ability has been activated but before it resolves, the card remains in whichever zone it moves to. It won't be exiled or return transformed.
2018/07/13: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
2018/07/13: While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. For example, Nicol Bolas has the characteristics of its creature face in the graveyard, even if it was a planeswalker on the battlefield before it was put into the graveyard.
2018/07/13: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up. The back face of a double-faced card can't be played.
2018/07/13: If another permanent that isn't a double-faced card (such as Mirror Image) becomes a copy of Nicol Bolas, the Ravager, activating the ability to exile it and return it transformed will only exile it. It won't return to the battlefield at all.
2018/07/13: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any permanents you control from Nicol Bolas's third loyalty ability that came from other players' graveyards are exiled.
2018/07/13: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card is the converted mana cost of its front face, even while it's on the battlefield with its back face up. For example, the converted mana cost of <Nicol Bolas, the Arisen> is 4.
2018/07/13: <Nicol Bolas, the Arisen> has a color indicator on its typeline. This color indicator means that it's a blue, black, and red permanent.
2018/07/13: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield.
2018/07/13: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause Nicol Bolas to transform while it's a creature on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.</Rulings>

2018/07/13: If any of the target permanents aren't sacrificed (most likely because one of them became an illegal target, such as by gaining hexproof), that permanent's controller won't reveal the top card of their library or put it onto the battlefield.

<Rulings>2018/07/13: The opponent stops exiling cards as soon as they exile any instant or sorcery card. You don't choose which card type to look for.
2018/07/13: If the opponent exiles their entire library without exiling an instant or sorcery card, that player stops exiling cards, and the exiled cards are put into their library in a random order.
2018/07/13: If you don't cast the exiled instant or sorcery card, it's put on the bottom of that library with the other cards.
2018/07/13: If you wish to cast the exiled card, you must cast it while <Chaos Wand>'s ability is resolving. You can't cast it later in the turn. A spell cast this way may be cast at a time you normally wouldn't be able to cast a spell of that type, but other restrictions (such as "Cast this spell only during combat") are enforced.
