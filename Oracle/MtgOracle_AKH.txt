Embalm {5}{W} ({5}{W}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Angel with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)</CardText>

<Multiverseid>426703</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If <Angel of Sanctions> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2017/04/18: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2017/04/18: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2017/04/18: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Angel of Sanctions> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2017/04/18: In a multiplayer game, if <Angel of Sanctions>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
2017/04/18: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/04/18: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/04/18: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves. You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: All of the tokens enter the battlefield simultaneously. They'll be created with the same name, color, type and subtype, abilities, power, toughness, and so on.
2017/04/18: If the token you create has any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities, first determine how many tokens are being created, then apply those abilities individually for each one. For example, if a token with "You may have [this permanent] enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield" would be created (such as an embalmed Vizier of Many Faces), the resulting two tokens can each copy a different creature.
2017/04/18: If an effect creates more than one kind of token, it'll create twice as many of each kind. For example, if you cast Bestial Menace while controlling <Anointed Procession>, you'll create two Snake tokens, two Wolf tokens, and two Elephant tokens.
2017/04/18: If you control two <Anointed Procession>s, then the number of tokens created is four times the original number. If you control three, then the number of tokens created is eight times the original number, and so on.
2017/04/18: If the effect creating the tokens instructs you to do something with those tokens at a later time, like exiling them at the end of combat, you'll do that for all the tokens.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards.

<Rulings>2017/04/18: If <Anointer Priest> is a token, most likely because it's embalmed, it will cause its own ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.
2017/04/18: If <Anointer Priest> enters the battlefield at the same time as a creature token, its ability triggers for that other creature. For example, if you control Anointed Procession and embalm <Anointer Priest>, the triggered ability of each one triggers twice and you gain a total of 4 life.

<Artist>Noah Bradley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426706</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: A card that changes zones is considered a new object, so casting the same <Approach of the Second Sun> card on a later turn is "another spell" named <Approach of the Second Sun>.
2017/04/18: If you have fewer than six cards in your library, you'll put <Approach of the Second Sun> on the bottom of your library. Otherwise, you'll lift up the top six cards without looking at them and place <Approach of the Second Sun> just under them.
2017/04/18: The second <Approach of the Second Sun> that you cast must be cast from your hand, but first may have been cast from anywhere.
2017/04/18: A copy of a spell isn't cast, so it won't count as the first nor as the second <Approach of the Second Sun>.
2017/04/18: As your second <Approach of the Second Sun> resolves, it checks only whether the first one was cast, not whether the first one resolved. If your first <Approach of the Second Sun> was countered, you'll still win the game as your second one resolves.
2017/07/14: <Approach of the Second Sun> has no effect until it's resolving. If the second one you cast is countered, you won't win the game.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: For effects that check whether a player searched a library, searching the top four cards of that library counts as searching that library.
2017/04/18: If an effect uses the word "search" once but allows an opponent to search for multiple cards, the top four cards remain the same throughout the entire search. Finding one card won't cause the fifth card to be included in the search.

<Artist>Zoltan Boros</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426712</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3.
2017/04/18: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes X, X is considered to be 0.
2017/04/18: All attackers are chosen at once. You can't attack with <Devoted Crop-Mate>, return a creature card to the battlefield, and then attack with that creature.
2017/04/18: If the creature returned to the battlefield has any abilities that trigger when creatures attack or when you exert creatures, those abilities won't trigger.
2017/04/18: You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.
2017/04/18: If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: If a creature has a targeted triggered ability that triggers when you exert it, you can exert it even if there isn't a legal target for that triggered ability.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set.

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Gideon's first ability will continue to prevent damage dealt by the target permanent even if Gideon leaves the battlefield before your next turn.
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
2017/04/18: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2017/04/18: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
2017/04/18: If Gideon leaves the battlefield after giving you his emblem, you'll keep the emblem. Its effect will apply again later if another Gideon comes under your control.
2017/04/18: No game effect can cause you to lose the game or cause any opponent to win the game while Gideon's emblem is in effect. It doesn't matter whether you have 0 or less life, you're forced to draw a card while your library is empty, you have ten or more poison counters, you're at your Glorious End, your opponent casts a second Approach of the Second Sun, or so on. You keep playing.
2017/04/18: Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your Magic Online® game clock runs out of time.
2017/04/18: If you have Gideon's emblem in a Two-Headed Giant game and control a Gideon planeswalker, your team can't lose the game and the opposing team can't win the game. If your teammate controls a Gideon planeswalker but you do not, your emblem's effect doesn't apply.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set. You can't do so later in combat, and creatures put onto the battlefield attacking can't be exerted. Any abilities that trigger on exerting an attacking creature will resolve before blockers are declared.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2017/04/18: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/04/18: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2017/04/18: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards.

2017/04/18: If an effect puts <Vizier of Remedies> onto the battlefield with one or more -1/-1 counters on it, its effect won't apply. This is because you must control <Vizier of Remedies> before the creature begins to enter the battlefield for its effect to apply. The same is true of any creatures entering the battlefield with -1/-1 counters on them at the same time as <Vizier of Remedies> enters the battlefield.
2017/04/18: If a creature you control is dealt damage by a source with wither or infect, that much damage is dealt, but one fewer -1/-1 counter is put on your creature. For example, if a 2/2 creature with lifelink and infect is blocked by <Vizier of Remedies>, the first creature's controller gains 2 life and puts one -1/-1 counter on <Vizier of Remedies>.
2017/04/18: If multiple creatures with wither and/or infect deal damage to a creature at once, <Vizier of Remedies> causes only one counter fewer to be put on that creature. Its effect doesn't apply separately for each creature dealing damage.
2017/04/18: Each additional <Vizier of Remedies> you control will decrease the number of -1/-1 counters put on a creature by one.</Rulings>

<CardText>At the beginning of your upkeep, put a time counter on As Foretold.

<Artist>Tommy Arnold</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426744</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If you cast a card for an alternative cost of {0}, you can't pay any other alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/04/18: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/04/18: If a spell has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0. You can cast it with <As Foretold>'s alternative cost.
2017/04/18: If you're casting a split card, only the converted mana cost of the half you're casting is compared to the number of time counters on <As Foretold>. This is because only that half is on the stack at the time that you choose to apply the effect of <As Foretold>.
2017/04/18: If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it for another cost that doesn't include X. For example, if there are five time counters on <As Foretold> and you choose to use its effect to cast Pull from Tomorrow, X must be 0. X can't be 2, even though the spell's converted mana cost would be 4.
2017/04/18: If you control multiple <As Foretold>s, you may cast one spell for each of them paying {0}.
2017/04/18: All counters with the same name are indistinguishable from other counters with that name. Cards from the Time Spiral block that interact with time counters will interact with <As Foretold>.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: <Vizier of Many Faces> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/04/18: The characteristics <Vizier of Many Faces> gains as part of its copy effect are copiable values that other effects may copy.
2017/04/18: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/04/18: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Vizier of Many Faces>), then <Vizier of Many Faces> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2017/04/18: If the chosen creature is a token, <Vizier of Many Faces> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Vizier of Many Faces> is not a token in this case unless it's embalmed.
2017/04/18: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Vizier of Many Faces> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2017/04/18: If <Vizier of Many Faces> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Vizier of Many Faces> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.

2017/04/18: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves.

2017/04/18: Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
2017/04/18: There's no main phase between your combat phases, so you'll have no opportunity to cast spells or activate abilities that could only be cast any time you could cast a sorcery. For example, you won't be able to cast another creature or equip Equipment between combats.
2017/04/18: If you exert <Combat Celebrant>, you get an additional combat phase even if <Combat Celebrant> doesn't survive the first combat phase.
2017/04/18: If you exert multiple <Combat Celebrant>s in one combat phase, you'll have that many additional combat phases, but all of your creatures are untapped only during the current combat phase. You'll need to exert the <Combat Celebrant>s one at a time, in multiple combat phases, to untap your attacking creatures and attack with them in each combat step.
2017/04/18: You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Ending the turn this way means the following things happen in order: 1) All spells and abilities on the stack are exiled.

No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. 5) The cleanup step happens in its entirety.
2017/04/18: If any triggered abilities do trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn is over.

Embalm {5}{R} ({5}{R}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Manticore with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Scott Murphy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426840</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: The sacrificed creature's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its power.
2017/04/18: You can't sacrifice multiple creatures to deal damage multiple times.
2017/04/18: <Heart-Piercer Manticore> features a new style of triggered ability. When it enters the battlefield, its triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, you may sacrifice a creature. If you do, a second ability triggers and you pick a target that will be dealt damage. This is different from other abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities before a creature is sacrificed and then again after the creature is sacrificed but before damage is dealt.
2017/04/18: <Heart-Piercer Manticore>'s damage-dealing ability triggers only when you sacrifice a creature as a result of the instruction of its triggered ability. It won't trigger if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.
2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
2017/04/18: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/04/18: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/04/18: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves. You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426850</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If an effect causes a creature you control to fight a creature an opponent controls, the damage is dealt simultaneously. For instance, if your 2/2 creature fights an opponent's 4/4 creature, your creature will be dealt 4 damage and your opponent's creature will have two -1/-1 counters put on it.
2017/04/18: If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes a source you control to deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, that damage will be replaced with -1/-1 counters.
2017/04/18: <Soul-Scar Mage>'s effect isn't a prevention effect. Damage that can't be prevented will be replaced with -1/-1 counters.
2017/04/18: If multiple prevention and/or replacement effects are trying to apply to the same damage, the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order in which to apply them. As examples, an opponent could choose to apply the effect of Djeru's Resolve and prevent the damage rather than put -1/-1 counters on it; or an opponent could choose to convert the damage to -1/-1 counters before Insult could double it, and then Insult's effect won't apply anymore.</Rulings>

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426874</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
2017/04/18: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/04/18: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves. You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.
2017/04/18: If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set. You can't do so later in combat, and creatures put onto the battlefield attacking can't be exerted. Any abilities that trigger on exerting an attacking creature will resolve before blockers are declared.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: <Naga Vitalist> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs or legality. For example, Spire of Industry says "{T}, Pay 1 life: Add one mana of any color. Activate this ability only if you control an artifact."

<Multiverseid>426894</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: <Vizier of the Menagerie> lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2017/04/18: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2017/04/18: Normally, <Vizier of the Menagerie> allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it any time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
2017/04/18: You may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast any creature spell, not just creature spells that you cast from the top of your library.
2017/04/18: You'll still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs such as emerge or that of As Foretold.
2017/04/18: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: If the target's owner's library contains no cards, the target spell or permanent will be put into that player's library as the only card.
2017/04/18: If a spell is put into its owner's library, it's removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn't countered; it just no longer exists. This works against a spell that can't be countered.
2017/04/18: If a copy of a spell or a token is put into its owner's library, it's moved there, then it will cease to exist as a state-based action.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.

<Rulings>2017/04/18: If a creature with trample you control would deal combat damage to a blocking creature this turn, you must assign its unmodified damage. For example, a 3/3 creature with trample blocked by a 2/2 creature can only have 1 damage assigned to the defending player. It will then deal 4 damage to the blocking creature and 2 to the defending player.
2017/04/18: If an effect such as that of Chandra's Pyrohelix asks you to divide damage among targets, you must divide the unmodified damage before doubling it.
2017/04/18: If you cast two <Insult>s in one turn, damage dealt by sources you control this turn will be multiplied by 4. If you cast three <Insult>s, it will be multiplied by 8, and so on. How rude.

2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: <Lead> doesn't give any creatures the ability to block the target creature. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block the creature to do so.
2017/04/18: As blockers are declared, any creature that's tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, no player is forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't block if that cost isn't paid.
2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.

2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.</Rulings>

<CardText>+2: Untap all creatures you control. Those creatures get +1/+1 until end of turn.
0: Until end of turn, Gideon, Martial Paragon becomes a 5/5 Human Soldier creature with indestructible that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn.

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>429662</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: All creatures you control get +1/+1 from Gideon's first ability, not just the ones that it untapped.
2017/04/18: The set of creatures affected by Gideon's first and third abilities is determined as the abilities resolve. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn and permanents you control that become creatures later in the turn won't get +1/+1 or +2/+2.
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
2017/04/18: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2017/04/18: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.</Rulings>
