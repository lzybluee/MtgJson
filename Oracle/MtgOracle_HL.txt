<CardText>You may choose not to untap Giant Oyster during your untap step.
{T}: For as long as Giant Oyster remains tapped, target tapped creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step, and at the beginning of each of your draw steps, put a -1/-1 counter on that creature. When Giant Oyster leaves the battlefield or becomes untapped, remove all -1/-1 counters from the creature.</CardText>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the Oyster untaps during the draw step before its ability to add a -1/-1 counter resolves, the -1/-1 counter effect resolves and adds a -1/-1 counter after the -1/-1 counters are removed due to being untapped.
2006/09/25: The activated ability can target only a tapped creature.
2006/09/25: Activating the ability creates a continuous effect that works only as long as <Giant Oyster> remains tapped, a repeating delayed triggered ability that's in effect only as long as <Giant Oyster> remains tapped, and a delayed triggered ability that triggers when <Giant Oyster> untaps or when it leaves the battlefield.
2006/09/25: <Giant Oyster>'s ability can be activated during your upkeep, and the creature will get a -1/-1 counter during the draw step that follows it.</Rulings>

<CardText>{G}: Beast Walkers gains banding until end of turn. (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)</CardText>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>
