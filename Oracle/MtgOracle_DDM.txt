<CardText>+1: Until your next turn, whenever a creature an opponent controls attacks, it gets -1/-0 until end of turn.
-2: Reveal the top three cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other on the bottom of your library in any order.
-8: For each player, search that player's library for a nonland card and exile it, then that player shuffles their library. You may cast those cards without paying their mana costs.</CardText>

<Multiverseid>380190</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/10/01: Jace's first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers whenever a creature an opponent controls attacks. It doesn't matter which player or planeswalker that creature is attacking.
2012/10/01: You pick one of your opponents when Jace's second ability resolves. The ability doesn't target that opponent. All players may see the revealed cards and offer opinions. You (not your opponent) choose which pile is put into your hand and which pile is put on the bottom of your library.
2012/10/01: Piles can be empty. If one of the piles is empty, you choose to put all the revealed cards in your hand or on the bottom of your library.
2012/10/01: When resolving Jace's third ability, you search each player's library (including yours) and exile the nonland cards before casting any of them.
2012/10/01: For each library, the search is complete only when you explicitly say it is. For example, you can look through one player's library, set that library down, look at another player's library, choose a nonland card in the first library, then choose a nonland card in the second library. Don't reveal any cards from those libraries to any other player until you exile them.
2012/10/01: You cast the cards by putting them on the stack one at a time, choosing modes, targets, and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve.
2012/10/01: When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2012/10/01: If you can't cast a card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast one, it will remain exiled. Jace's ability won't allow you to cast it later.
2012/10/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2012/10/01: If a card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: The last ability of <Jace's Phantasm> constantly monitors each opponent's graveyard to see if the bonus applies. If the stated condition becomes no longer true, the bonus immediately stops applying.
2017/11/17: If <Jace's Phantasm> is dealt lethal damage at the same time as an opponent's creature, and that creature will become that opponent's tenth card in their graveyard, <Jace's Phantasm> will be destroyed before it gets +4/+4. This is because all creatures that have been dealt lethal damage are destroyed at the same time.
2017/11/17: In a multiplayer game, a single opponent must have ten or more cards in their graveyard for the bonus to apply, although this opponent may change over the course of the game. You don't have to pick a single opponent; the ability will monitor each opponent's graveyard.</Rulings>

2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.

This means that if you want to return <Agoraphobia> to its owner's hand before combat damage is dealt, you must do so before combat damage is assigned (and the creature will no longer get -5/-0).</Rulings>

Whenever Spawnwrithe deals combat damage to a player, create a token that's a copy of Spawnwrithe.</CardText>
<Flavor>Its victims feel only an itchy, wriggling feeling just under their skin. By then, it's far too late.</Flavor>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>380196</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the <Spawnwrithe> it's copying — or, if the <Spawnwrithe> whose ability triggered was itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the <Spawnwrithe>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Spawnwrithe>'s power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a <Spawnwrithe>. But if any copy effects have affected that <Spawnwrithe>, they're taken into account.
2008/05/01: If <Spawnwrithe>'s ability triggers, then <Spawnwrithe> becomes a copy of another creature before its ability resolves (due to Mirrorweave, perhaps), the token will be a copy of whatever creature the <Spawnwrithe> is currently a copy of. At the end of the turn, <Spawnwrithe> will revert back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is.
2008/05/01: If a copy effect such as Mirrorweave causes some other creature to become a copy of <Spawnwrithe>, then that creature deals combat damage to a player, the token that's put onto the battlefield is simply a copy of <Spawnwrithe>.
2008/05/01: A token created by a Cemetery Puca that's copying a <Spawnwrithe> will be a <Spawnwrithe> with the Cemetery Puca ability.</Rulings>
