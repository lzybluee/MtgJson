<Artist>Simon Dominic</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: If <Lumbering Battlement> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, you can't exile any nontoken creatures.
2019/01/25: Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist. When the cards return to the battlefield, they will be new objects with no connection to the cards that were exiled.

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by <Tithe Taker>.
2019/01/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as that of <Tithe Taker>'s effect), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/01/25: An opponent's activated ability that costs no mana to activate will cost {1} plus its non-mana costs during your turn.

2019/01/25: If <Simic Ascendancy> doesn't have twenty or more growth counters on it as your upkeep begins, its last ability won't trigger. You can't take any actions during your turn before your upkeep begins.
2019/01/25: If the last ability does trigger, but counters are removed from <Simic Ascendancy> so it has fewer than twenty remaining on it, you won't win the game.
2019/01/25: If the last ability does trigger, but <Simic Ascendancy> leaves the battlefield, use the number of counters it had on it immediately before it left the battlefield to determine whether you win the game.</Rulings>

<CardText>If a creature dying causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
Creature tokens you control have vigilance and lifelink.</CardText>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Teysa affects a creature's own "when this creature dies" triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that creature dies. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2019/01/25: Teysa's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to pay a cost for that triggered ability, are also made separately.
2019/01/25: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "creatures." In these cases, the trigger event may also refer to something being "put into a graveyard from the battlefield." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield" would trigger twice if an artifact creature dies while <Teysa Karlov> is on the battlefield.
2019/01/25: An ability that triggers when a creature "leaves the battlefield" will trigger twice if that creature leaves the battlefield by dying.
2019/01/25: An ability that triggers on an event that causes a creature to die doesn't trigger twice. For example, an ability that triggers "whenever you sacrifice a creature" triggers only once.
2019/01/25: Look at each creature as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if a land that has become a creature dies, an ability that triggers when it dies triggers twice.
2019/01/25: If a creature dying at the same time that another permanent you control leaves the battlefield causes a triggered ability of that permanent to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/01/25: If a creature dying at the same time as Teysa (including Teysa itself dying) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/01/25: If you somehow control two Teysas, a creature dying causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Teysa causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on. This also means that if you control Teysa and cast a second one, an ability that triggers when it dies due to the "legend rule" triggers three times.
2019/01/25: An ability of a permanent that triggers when a card is put into a graveyard "from anywhere" triggers twice only if Teysa and that permanent are both still on the battlefield immediately after the creature has died.</Rulings>

<CardText>At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library.

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
2019/01/25: <Theater of Horrors> doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards during your turn. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2019/01/25: Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2019/01/25: In a multiplayer game, if an opponent loses life during your turn and then leaves the game, you can play cards exiled with <Theater of Horrors>.</Rulings>

2019/01/25: If a creature somehow loses all of its +1/+1 counters, it can adapt again and get more +1/+1 counters.</Rulings>
