<Rulings>2015/02/25: Turning a face-down creature with megamorph face up and putting a +1/+1 counter on it is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/02/25: If a face-down creature with megamorph is turned face up some other way (for example, if you manifest a card with megamorph and then pay its mana cost to turn it face up), you won't put a +1/+1 counter on it.

2015/02/25: If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus.

<Rulings>2015/02/25: Face-down creatures have a converted mana cost of 0. If one is exiled by <Silkwrap>, it will return to the battlefield face up.
2015/02/25: <Silkwrap>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Silkwrap> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Silkwrap> leaves the battlefield.
2015/02/25: If <Silkwrap> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2015/02/25: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.

2015/02/25: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Silkwrap> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/02/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Silkwrap>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/02/25: A token that enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down creature is a face-up colorless 2/2 creature with no name, abilities, or creature types.
2015/02/25: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/02/25: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
2015/02/25: If the copied creature is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2015/02/25: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Clone Legion> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
2015/02/25: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.

<Rulings>2015/02/25: The target creature will lose all other colors and creature types and be blue, a Dragon, and an Illusion. It will retain any other types it may have had, such as artifact.
2015/02/25: The target creature will lose any abilities it may have gained prior to <Dance of the Skywise> resolving. Notably, if the creature is a face-down creature with morph or megamorph, you can't turn it face up, as it wouldn't have a morph or megamorph cost when face up (because it's lost all abilities other than flying).
2015/02/25: After <Dance of the Skywise> resolves, the creature can gain abilities as normal.
2015/02/25: <Dance of the Skywise> overrides all previous effects that set the creature's power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after <Dance of the Skywise> resolves will override this effect.
2015/02/25: Effects that modify the power or toughness of the creature, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Hall of Triumph, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2015/02/25: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2015/02/25: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

The same is true for counters that change its power (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2015/02/25: If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.
2015/02/25: Some formidable abilities are activated abilities that require creatures you control to have total power 8 or greater. Once you activate these abilities, it doesn't matter what happens to the total power of creatures you control.
2015/02/25: Other formidable abilities are triggered abilities with an "intervening 'if'" clause. Such abilities check the total power of creatures you control twice: once at the appropriate time to see if the ability will trigger, and again as the ability tries to resolve. If, at that time, the total power of creatures you control is no longer 8 or greater, the ability will have no effect.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: If one of these spells is copied, the controller of the copy will get the "Dragon bonus" only if a Dragon card was revealed as an additional cost. The copy wasn't cast, so whether you controlled a Dragon won't matter.
2015/02/25: You can't reveal more than one Dragon card to multiply the bonus. There is also no additional benefit for both revealing a Dragon card as an additional cost and controlling a Dragon as you cast the spell.
2015/02/25: If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus. For example, if you lose control of your only Dragon while casting the spell (because, for example, you sacrificed it to activate a mana ability), you won't get the bonus.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: If you choose the second mode, and if a permanent you control is being targeted by a spell when <Display of Dominance> resolves, nothing happens right away. When that spell would resolve, its color is checked. If it's blue or black, that permanent will be an illegal target for that spell and won't be affected by it. If all that spell's targets have become illegal by the time it would resolve, it's countered.
2015/02/25: If you choose the second mode, no new blue or black spell may be cast by an opponent that turn targeting a permanent you control after <Display of Dominance> resolves.
2015/02/25: If you choose the second mode, <Display of Dominance> will affect any permanent you happen to control at any point during the rest of the turn, not just permanents you control as it resolves. That's because it doesn't grant an ability to those permanents; rather, it affects the game rules and states something that's now true about those permanents.
2015/02/25: Keep in mind that an Aura spell targets the permanent it will enchant (but an Aura on the battlefield doesn't target the permanent it's attached to).

<Rulings>2015/02/25: If one of these spells is copied, the controller of the copy will get the "Dragon bonus" only if a Dragon card was revealed as an additional cost. The copy wasn't cast, so whether you controlled a Dragon won't matter.
2015/02/25: You can't reveal more than one Dragon card to multiply the bonus. There is also no additional benefit for both revealing a Dragon card as an additional cost and controlling a Dragon as you cast the spell.
2015/02/25: If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus. For example, if you lose control of your only Dragon while casting the spell (because, for example, you sacrificed it to activate a mana ability), you won't get the bonus.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: The first ability of <Shaman of Forgotten Ways> is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/02/25: The mana produced by <Shaman of Forgotten Ways> can be used to cast face-down creature spells with morph or megamorph.
2015/02/25: Count the number of creatures each player controls when the last ability resolves to determine what number each player's life total will become.
2015/02/25: For a player's life total to become a specific number, the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if a player's life total is 12 and that player controls three creatures as the ability resolves, they will lose 9 life. Other effects that interact with life gain or loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2015/02/25: If a player controls no creatures as the last ability resolves, their life total will become 0, causing that player to lose the game. If all players' life totals become 0 this way, the game will be a draw.
2015/02/25: If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.
2015/02/25: Some formidable abilities are activated abilities that require creatures you control to have total power 8 or greater. Once you activate these abilities, it doesn't matter what happens to the total power of creatures you control.
2015/02/25: Other formidable abilities are triggered abilities with an "intervening 'if'" clause. Such abilities check the total power of creatures you control twice: once at the appropriate time to see if the ability will trigger, and again as the ability tries to resolve. If, at that time, the total power of creatures you control is no longer 8 or greater, the ability will have no effect.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: A creature entering the battlefield with one or more +1/+1 counters on it will cause <Enduring Scalelord>'s ability to trigger.

2015/02/25: If you control two <Enduring Scalelord>s, putting a +1/+1 counter on one of them will cause the ability of the other one to trigger. When this ability resolves, you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the other Scalelord. This will cause the ability of the first one to trigger. This loop will repeat until you choose not to put a +1/+1 counter on one of the <Enduring Scalelord>s.</Rulings>
