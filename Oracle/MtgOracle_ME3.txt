<CardText>As Call to Arms enters the battlefield, choose a color and an opponent.
White creatures get +1/+1 as long as the chosen color is the most common color among nontoken permanents the chosen player controls but isn't tied for most common.
When the chosen color isn't the most common color among nontoken permanents the chosen player controls or is tied for most common, sacrifice Call to Arms.</CardText>

<Multiverseid>201147</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You can't choose "colorless" as a color.
2009/10/01: <Call to Arms> affects all white creatures, not just white creatures you control.
2009/10/01: If <Call to Arms> changes controllers, it will continue to check the nontoken permanents controlled by the player chosen as it entered the battlefield, even if that player isn't an opponent of its current controller.
2009/10/01: The game continually counts the number of nontoken permanents of each color the chosen player controls. Multicolored ones are counted for each of their colors; colorless ones are ignored. The moment the number of nontoken permanents of the chosen color that player controls is less than or equal to the number of permanents of one of the other colors that player controls, <Call to Arms>'s second ability stops giving white creatures +1/+1 and its third ability triggers. <Call to Arms> will be sacrificed when the third ability resolves, even if those numbers have changed by then.
2009/10/01: <Call to Arms>'s third ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: When <Divine Intervention>'s third ability resolves, the game ends immediately. The game is a draw, meaning neither player wins and neither player loses.
2009/10/01: <Divine Intervention>'s third ability triggers only if its controller removes the last intervention counter from it. It doesn't matter how that happens. For example, if you control <Divine Intervention> and the last intervention counter is removed as a result of a Clockspinning you control, the ability will trigger. On the other hand, if the last intervention counter is removed as a result of a Clockspinning another player controls, the ability won't trigger (and won't ever be able to).
2009/10/01: In a multiplayer game played with the limited range of influence option, <Divine Intervention> won't necessarily end the entire game when its third ability resolves. All players within range of <Divine Intervention> will leave the game. They'll neither win nor lose; as far as they're concerned, the result of the game is a draw. All other players will continue playing.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.

For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you untap a tapped Vivid Crag an opponent controls while paying for <Benthic Explorers>'s ability, you can add one mana of any color. It doesn't matter whether that Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it.
2009/10/01: When determining what types of mana an opponent's land could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to that land's mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Benthic Explorers> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders an opponent's land (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) puts on the mana it produces. It just cares about types of mana.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: The ability is targeted and checks the validity of the target when put on the stack and when resolving. If the creature is not still there when the copy ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve and no token is put onto the battlefield. This card remains on the battlefield as an enchantment with no token.

Then its first ability will resolve and put a token onto the battlefield. That token won't have any connection to a <Dance of Many> permanent, so it won't be exiled when a <Dance of Many> leaves the battlefield.</Rulings>

The same is true if the targeted creature's power becomes greater than <Old Man of the Sea>'s power before the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: The ability doesn't care whether <Old Man of the Sea> remains under your control, only that <Old Man of the Sea> remains tapped and its power remains large enough. If an opponent gains control of <Old Man of the Sea>, you'll keep control of the affected creature (until <Old Man of the Sea> stops being tapped or it no longer has enough power).
2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the targeted permanent remains a legal target for the ability, only that it's on the battlefield and its power remains small enough. The effect will continue to apply to it even if it gains shroud, stops being a creature, or would no longer be a legal target for any other reason. If it stops being a creature, its power is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

When enchanted creature dies, that creature's controller chooses a creature that Takklemaggot could enchant.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the creature leaves the battlefield without going to the graveyard, <Takklemaggot> is simply put into its owner's graveyard.

The player who controlled it when it left the battlefield is the same player that controls it when it returns to the battlefield, even though a different player may be choosing what it will be attached to after returning onto the battlefield.
2009/10/01: When the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard, <Takklemaggot>'s second ability triggers, then <Takklemaggot> is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. When the ability resolves, if <Takklemaggot> is still in that graveyard, it's returned to the battlefield.
2009/10/01: The player who controlled the creature that went to the graveyard (and caused <Takklemaggot>'s second ability to trigger) chooses what creature <Takklemaggot> will return to the battlefield attached to. The creature isn't chosen until the ability resolves, so no player can respond between the time the creature is chosen and the time <Takklemaggot> returns to the battlefield attached to it. The ability doesn't target a creature, so a creature with shroud, for example, can be chosen. However, only a creature that can be legally enchanted by <Takklemaggot> can be chosen, so a creature with protection from black, for example, can't be chosen. If the player can choose a creature, they must do so, no matter who controls it. If the player can't choose a creature, <Takklemaggot> returns to the battlefield as a non-Aura enchantment, and that player is the player that <Takklemaggot> will deal damage to.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/11/01: Has changed slightly in functionality, with the old continuous nature of the toughness reduction gone away; the toughness change remains static. For example, if you have three Swamps and Nightmare on the battlefield and then cast <Blood Lust> on it, it will become 7/1. If one of your Swamps is subsequently destroyed, your Nightmare will become 6/0 and be put in the graveyard.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>201176</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: This effect modifies the announcement of an attack, so it only works if it is on the battlefield at that time.
2008/10/01: This has the supertype world. When a world permanent enters the battlefield, any world permanents that were already on the battlefield are put into their owners' graveyards. This is a state-based action called the "world rule." The new world permanent stays on the battlefield. If two world permanents enter the battlefield at the same time, they're both put into their owners' graveyards.
2009/10/01: <Arboria> doesn't stop creatures from attacking planeswalkers, regardless of what their controllers did or didn't do during their last turns.
2009/10/01: <Arboria>'s effect cares whether a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. It's unusual for an ability to care who did the putting (as opposed to whose control the permanent entered the battlefield under), and requires careful reading of spells and abilities to see which player is instructed to put something onto the battlefield. For example, Exhume causes each player to return a creature card from their graveyard to the battlefield. If Exhume's controller has no creature cards in their graveyard, but another player does, only that other player puts a permanent onto the battlefield. It doesn't matter who controls the effect.
2009/10/01: <Arboria>'s effect cares about the actions taken by players, not their results. If a player cast a spell during their last turn but that spell was countered, that player may still be attacked. The same is true if a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield during their last turn, even if it's no longer on the battlefield by the time that player is attacked.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>201217</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: During your untap step, first you determine which of your permanents will untap, then you untap them. If you control a permanent that says "You may choose not to untap [this permanent] during your untap step" and you decide not to untap it, no wind counters will be removed from it because it wouldn't untap. The same is true for a permanent you control that wouldn't untap due to a spell or ability (such as the one from Barl's Cage).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: You apply power/toughness changing effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (a) effects from characteristic-defining abilities; (b) effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (c) effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (d) changes from counters; (e) effects that switch a creature's power and toughness. This card's effect is always applied in (b), which means that effects applied in sublayer (c), (d), or (e) will not be overwritten; they will be applied to the new value.
2009/10/01: Note that the duration of <Halfdane>'s ability is until the end of your next upkeep. If <Halfdane>'s ability doesn't get a chance to resolve (because there are no legal targets when it triggers, or because it's countered), then the effect from the previous turn's ability will continue to work through the rest of that upkeep step. Then that effect will wear off, and <Halfdane> will revert to being 3/3, its printed power and toughness (unless some other effect is modifying what its power and toughness is).</Rulings>

<CardText>When Hazezon Tamar enters the battlefield, create X 1/1 Sand Warrior creature tokens that are red, green, and white at the beginning of your next upkeep, where X is the number of lands you control at that time.
When Hazezon leaves the battlefield, exile all Sand Warriors.</CardText>
<Artist>Richard Kane Ferguson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>201193</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: When <Hazezon Tamar>'s second ability resolves, all permanents with both the Sand and Warrior creature types are exiled, not just the Sand Warrior creature tokens it created. Permanents that have just one of those types are unaffected.
2009/10/01: The first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of your next upkeep. It doesn't matter who controls <Hazezon Tamar> at that time, or even if it's on the battlefield. The player who put Hazezon onto the battlefield gets the Sand Warriors.
2009/10/01: Only Sand Warriors that are actually on the battlefield when <Hazezon Tamar> leaves the battlefield are affected when its second ability resolves. If Hazezon leaves the battlefield after the delayed triggered ability created by its first ability triggers but before that ability resolves, its second ability triggers and resolves first, then the Sand Warriors are put on the battlefield. Those Sand Warriors will remain on the battlefield indefinitely.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Multiverseid>201197</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Kjeldoran Frostbeast>'s ability triggers only if it's still on the battlefield when the end of combat step begins (after the combat damage step). For example, if it blocks a 7/7 creature and is destroyed, its ability won't trigger at all. The 7/7 will remain on the battlefield.
2009/10/01: Its ability will destroy all creatures it's currently blocking or blocked by, not necessarily the creatures it had blocked or become blocked by during that combat phase. For example, if <Kjeldoran Frostbeast> is dealt lethal combat damage and regenerates, it's removed from combat. Its ability will trigger at end of combat, but since it's no longer blocking or blocked by any creatures, the ability won't do anything.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.
2004/10/04: The ability can be activated if the opponent has no lands that produce mana, but the effect will not be able to generate any mana.
2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Fellwar Stone> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>201235</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: As you activate the ability, the targets you choose must be two artifacts, two creatures, or two lands. As the ability resolves, both targets will be legal only if they are two artifacts, two creatures, or two lands at that time as well, though they may be a different type than they were at the time the ability was activated. For example, if the targets were a creature and an artifact creature when the ability was activated, but the first target became a noncreature artifact by the time the ability resolves, both targets will still be legal (since they're both artifacts).
2009/10/01: If one of the targets is illegal by the time the ability resolves (because the wrong player controls it, or it's the wrong card type, or for any other reason), the exchange doesn't happen. The target that's still legal will remain under its controller's control. Since the exchange doesn't happen, no Auras are destroyed. (If both targets are illegal, the ability doesn't resolve.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The creature's "enters the battlefield" abilities (and any other abilities relating to the creature entering the battlefield) do not trigger when it turns face up.
2004/10/04: Only the controller of the face down creature can look at it.
2004/10/04: The creature enters the battlefield face down, so none of its "enters the battlefield" abilities will trigger or have any effect. Also none of its "As this enters the battlefield" abilities apply.
2009/10/01: <Illusionary Mask>'s ability will continue to apply to creatures cast face down with it, even if <Illusionary Mask> has left the battlefield.
2009/10/01: While the creature card is face down, it's a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, color, creature type, abilities, or expansion symbol. Since it has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0.
2009/10/01: You may look at a face-down spell or permanent you control at any time.
2009/10/01: You can turn a face-down permanent face up if it would have morph while face up. This applies to creatures you cast face down as a result of <Illusionary Mask>'s effect. The rest of <Illusionary Mask>'s effect applies to it as well.
2009/10/01: If you use the ability to cast a creature card face down, you must keep track of the amount and types of mana you spent on {X}. If that creature spell is moved from the stack to anywhere other than the battlefield, the resulting creature leaves the battlefield, or the game ends, the face-down card is revealed. If its mana cost couldn't be paid by some amount of, or all of, the mana you spent on {X}, all applicable penalties for casting a card illegally are assessed.
2009/10/01: You actually cast the card face-down, much as when playing a spell with Morph. It can be responded to and countered.
2009/10/01: The effect that turns it face-up is a replacement effect. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2009/10/01: You may not turn a face-down spell face up. You may not turn a face-down permanent face up unless it would have morph while face up or an effect specifically allows you to turn it face up. <Illusionary Mask>'s ability has you turn a face-down creature face up if it would assign damage, deal damage, be dealt damage, or become tapped, but not for any other reason. For example, if you use <Illusionary Mask>'s ability to cast a black creature face down, you can't turn it face up just because it's being targeted by Terror.
2009/10/01: Both the amount and types of mana you spend on {X} are taken into account while you're choosing a creature card from your hand. For example, if you spent {U}{U} on {X}, you can choose a creature card with mana cost {U}{U}, {1}{U}, {2}, or {W/U}{W/U}, among other possibilities, but not one that costs {2}{U} or one that costs {G}.</Rulings>

If <Voodoo Doll> is no longer on the battlefield as the ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see if it was tapped or untapped.
2009/10/01: Each X in the cost of <Voodoo Doll>'s third ability is the number of pin counters on <Voodoo Doll> at the time you activate the ability. The X in the ability's effect is the number of pin counters on <Voodoo Doll> at the time it resolves, which may not be the same number (if a spell or ability put counters on it or removed counters from it in the meantime).

<Name>Sorrow's Path</Name>
<Type>Land</Type>
<CardText>{T}: Choose two target blocking creatures an opponent controls. If each of those creatures could block all creatures that the other is blocking, remove both of them from combat. Each one then blocks all creatures the other was blocking.
Whenever Sorrow's Path becomes tapped, it deals 2 damage to you and each creature you control.</CardText>
<Artist>Randy Asplund-Faith</Artist>
<Multiverseid>201268</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: This has two abilities. The second ability triggers any time it becomes tapped, whether to pay for its ability or not.
2009/10/01: When <Sorrow's Path>'s first ability is activated, its second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of the first ability. The second ability resolves first, and may cause some of the attacking creatures to be dealt lethal damage.
2009/10/01: The first ability can target any two blocking creatures a single opponent controls. Whether those creatures could block all creatures the other is blocking isn't determined until the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: A "blocking creature" is one that has been declared as a blocker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield blocking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be a blocking creature through the end of combat step, even if the creature or creatures that it was blocking are no longer on the battlefield or have otherwise left combat by then.
2009/10/01: Abilities that trigger whenever one of the targeted creatures blocks will trigger when the first ability resolves, because those creatures will change from not blocking (since they're removed from combat) to blocking. It doesn't matter if those abilities triggered when those creatures blocked the first time. Abilities that trigger whenever one of the attacking creatures becomes blocked will not trigger again, because they never stopped being blocked creatures. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature blocks one of the attacking creatures will trigger again, though; those kinds of abilities trigger once for each creature that blocks.
2009/10/01: When determining whether a creature could block all creatures the other is blocking, take into account evasion abilities (like flying), protection abilities, and other blocking restrictions, as well as abilities that allow a creature to block multiple creatures or block as though a certain condition were true. Take into account whether those creatures are tapped, but not whether they have costs to block (since those apply only as blockers are declared).
2009/10/01: When the first ability resolves, if all the creatures that one of the targeted creatures was blocking have left combat, then the other targeted creature is considered to be able to block all creatures the first creature is blocking. If the ability has its full effect, the second creature will be removed from combat but not returned to combat; it doesn't block anything.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The ability can be used on a creature without First Strike or Swampwalk but has no effect.
2008/04/01: If a creature loses first strike after first strike combat damage has been assigned, it won't deal damage during the second combat damage step.
2009/10/01: You choose whether the targeted creature loses first strike or swampwalk as the ability resolves. If the creature has both abilities, it will lose just one of them.
2009/10/01: Causing a creature to lose swampwalk is useful only during the declare attackers step or earlier. Once the declare blockers step begins, it's too late to block the creature.
2009/10/01: <Urborg>'s second ability affects only the first strike ability, not the part of the double strike ability that acts like first strike.</Rulings>
