<CardText>+1: Until end of turn, up to one target creature gets +1/+1 and gains first strike, vigilance, and lifelink.
-2: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control and a loyalty counter on each other planeswalker you control.
-7: You get an emblem with "If a source would deal damage to you or a planeswalker you control, prevent all but 1 of that damage."</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383180</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: You may activate the first ability with no targets. If you do, you simply put a loyalty counter on Ajani to pay the cost of the ability.
2014/07/18: If a permanent you control is both a creature and a planeswalker, Ajani's second ability will put both a +1/+1 counter and a loyalty counter on it.
2014/07/18: The emblem's ability doesn't consider who controls the source dealing damage to you or a planeswalker you control.
2014/07/18: Each attacking creature is a separate source of damage. For example, if two 3/3 creatures attack you and are unblocked, the emblem will prevent 2 damage from each creature. You'll be dealt a total of 2 damage.
2014/07/18: If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Dictate of the Twin Gods says, "If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead." Suppose you would be dealt 3 damage while Dictate of the Twin Gods is on the battlefield and you control Ajani's emblem. You can either (a) prevent all but 1 damage first and then let Dictate of the Twin Gods's effect double that, for a result of being dealt 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent all but 1 of that damage.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>383181</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: The ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Auriok Champion or 6 life from Tavern Swindler.
2017/11/17: If <Ajani's Pridemate> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2017/11/17: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Ajani's Pridemate>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2017/11/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>383185</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The possible color choices are white, blue, black, red, and green. You can't choose artifact, colorless, or any other word.
2014/07/18: For each activated ability, you choose the color as the ability resolves. However, the color of a source that would deal damage to the permanent or player is checked only when it would deal that damage, not as Avacyn's ability resolves. For example, if you choose blue, damage a blue creature would deal is prevented, even if that creature wasn't blue (or wasn't on the battlefield) when Avacyn's ability resolved.
2014/07/18: Whether the target permanent or player is still a legal target is no longer checked after the appropriate ability resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by the first ability gains protection from white after the ability resolves but before it prevents damage, the effect will still prevent damage.
2014/07/18: Both activated abilities prevent all damage of the chosen color, not just combat damage.
2014/07/18: Neither activated ability has any effect on damage that's already been dealt.</Rulings>

<CardText>Sliver creatures you control have "When this creature enters the battlefield, you may exile target creature an opponent controls until this creature leaves the battlefield."</CardText>
<Flavor>Slivers are often seen toying with enemies they capture, not out of cruelty, but to fully learn their physical capabilities.</Flavor>
<Artist>Karl Kopinski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383215</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: <Constricting Sliver> gives Slivers you control an ability that causes a zone change with a duration, a newer style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring's abilities, this ability creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after the Sliver leaves the battlefield.
2014/07/18: When <Constricting Sliver> enters the battlefield, the ability it gives itself will trigger.
2014/07/18: The Sliver that enters the battlefield is the source of the ability that exiles the creature. For example, if a blue Sliver enters the battlefield under your control, the ability can target and exile a creature with protection from white.
2014/07/18: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards (unless they're Theros block cards with the bestow ability). Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2014/07/18: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2014/07/18: If a Sliver leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2014/07/18: If a Sliver you control leaves the battlefield, only the card that particular Sliver exiled will return to the battlefield. Each card exiled by another Sliver will remain exiled until that Sliver leaves the battlefield.
2014/07/18: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after the Sliver leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Mercurial Pretender, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of the Sliver.
2014/07/18: The exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control.
2014/07/18: The exiled card will return even if the Sliver whose ability exiled it doesn't have that ability at the time (perhaps because <Constricting Sliver> is no longer on the battlefield).
2014/07/18: In a multiplayer game, if the Sliver's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2014/07/18: Slivers in this set affect only Sliver creatures you control. They don't grant bonuses to your opponents' Slivers. This is the same way Slivers from the Magic 2014 core set worked, while Slivers in earlier sets granted bonuses to all Slivers.
2014/07/18: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like indestructible and the ability granted by Belligerent Sliver, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.
2014/07/18: If you change the creature type of a Sliver you control so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures you control.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>383224</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: You can tap untapped attacking or blocking creatures you control to help cast <Devouring Light>. This doesn't remove those creatures from combat.
2014/07/18: The declare blockers step is the last chance to cast <Devouring Light> before creatures deal their combat damage. However, a creature remains an attacking or blocking creature during the combat damage step and end of combat step. <Devouring Light> may be cast targeting such a creature during those steps, after the creature has dealt combat damage.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
2014/07/18: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected.
2014/07/18: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with Mercurial Pretender, are also unaffected.
2014/07/18: <Hushwing Gryff>'s ability stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.
2014/07/18: The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, Amulet of Vigor says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would not trigger. If a land (that isn't also a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would trigger.
2014/07/18: Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control March of the Machines, which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," each artifact will be a creature at the time it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
2014/07/18: If <Hushwing Gryff> and another creature enter the battlefield at the same time, neither creature entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383207</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: Multiple instances of convoke on a single spell are redundant.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: Slivers in this set affect only Sliver creatures you control. They don't grant bonuses to your opponents' Slivers. This is the same way Slivers from the Magic 2014 core set worked, while Slivers in earlier sets granted bonuses to all Slivers.
2014/07/18: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like indestructible and the ability granted by Belligerent Sliver, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.
2014/07/18: If you change the creature type of a Sliver you control so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures you control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The artifact retains any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has. Notably, if an Equipment becomes an artifact creature, it can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.
2014/07/18: If the artifact was already a creature, its base power and toughness will each become 5. This overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after <Ensoul Artifact> becomes attached to the artifact will overwrite this effect.
2014/07/18: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the ones created by Titanic Growth or a +/1+1 counter, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
2014/07/18: The resulting artifact creature will be able to attack on your turn if it's been under your control continuously since the turn began. That is, it doesn't matter how long it's been a creature, just how long it's been on the battlefield.</Rulings>

It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, etc. For example, if <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as a copy of a Profane Memento with Ensoul Artifact attached to it, <Mercurial Pretender> will be a noncreature Profane Memento with <Mercurial Pretender>'s added activated ability.
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Genesis Hydra), X is 0.
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Mercurial Pretender>), then <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying (plus any abilities it gained as part of the copying process, if applicable).
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature is a token, <Mercurial Pretender> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Mercurial Pretender> is not a token, even when copying one.
2014/07/18: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2014/07/18: If <Mercurial Pretender> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Mercurial Pretender> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2014/07/18: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Creatures that enter the battlefield or come under the target player's control after <Polymorphist's Jest> resolves won't be affected.
2014/07/18: The creatures will lose all other colors and creature types, but they will retain any other card types (such as artifact) or supertypes (such as legendary) they may have.
2014/07/18: <Polymorphist's Jest> overwrites all previous effects that set the creatures' base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after <Polymorphist's Jest> resolves will overwrite this effect.
2014/07/18: <Polymorphist's Jest> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
2014/07/18: If one of the affected creatures gains an ability after <Polymorphist's Jest> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2014/07/18: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creatures no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change their power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
2014/07/18: If one of the Theros block Gods is affected by <Polymorphist's Jest>, it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities. If it stops being a creature, perhaps because your devotion to its color(s) decreased, it will be a legendary blue enchantment with no abilities.

The way continuous effects work, <Stormtide Leviathan>'s type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes that ability is applied.

Covenant of Blood deals 4 damage to any target and you gain 4 life.</CardText>
<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383217</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: If the target permanent or player is an illegal target when <Covenant of Blood> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't gain any life. (Any creatures you tapped to cast <Covenant of Blood> remain tapped.)
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<CardText>Convoke (Your creatures can help cast this spell. Each creature you tap while casting this spell pays for {1} or one mana of that creature's color.)
Put target creature card from a graveyard onto the battlefield under your control.</CardText>
<Artist>Karl Kopinski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383231</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/07/18: In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
2014/07/18: While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
2014/07/18: While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
2014/07/18: Because you're casting the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/07/18: If the copied card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copies.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Although <Goblin Rabblemaster> doesn't force itself to attack, if you control two of them, they'll force each other to attack if able.
2014/07/18: If, during your declare attackers step, a creature that must attack if able is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under your control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, you're not forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2014/07/18: The number of attacking Goblins is counted as the last ability resolves, and the bonus is locked in at that time.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: The copy will have the same targets as the ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/07/18: If the ability is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.

2014/07/18: If paying the activation cost of the ability includes sacrificing Kurkesh, the ability won't be copied. At the time the ability is considered activated (after all costs are paid), Kurkesh is no longer on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Barger</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383404</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast <Chord of Calling> (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

This doesn't target any permanent or player, but it must be able to enchant that permanent or player.

<CardText>Convoke (Your creatures can help cast this spell. Each creature you tap while casting this spell pays for {1} or one mana of that creature's color.)
Trample (This creature can deal excess combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.)</CardText>
<Artist>Carl Critchlow</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383382</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: For the first ability, it doesn't matter whether the planeswalker is still on the battlefield as your end step begins. If you activated one of its loyalty abilities that turn, <The Chain Veil>'s triggered ability won't trigger.
2014/07/18: Because the last ability modifies the rules of the game, it affects not only planeswalkers you control when it resolves, but also planeswalkers that come under your control later in the turn.
2014/07/18: After the last ability resolves, you'll essentially be able to activate a loyalty ability of each planeswalker you control a total of twice during your turn. The timing rules for when you can activate loyalty abilities apply each time; it must be your main phase and the stack must be empty.
2014/07/18: The second loyalty ability you activate doesn't have to be the same as the first ability. For example, you could activate a planeswalker's first ability twice, or you could activate a planeswalker's first ability, then activate its second ability.
2014/07/18: Each additional time <The Chain Veil>'s last ability resolves will allow you to activate a loyalty ability of each planeswalker you control an additional time. For example, if you activate <The Chain Veil>'s last ability, untap it, then activate it again, you can activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker you control three times that turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Severin Brassell</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383331</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: You must choose an existing creature type.
2014/07/18: The choice of creature type is made as <Obelisk of Urd> enters the battlefield. Players can't respond to this choice. The bonus starts applying immediately.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>383378</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: To determine how much damage to prevent, use the number of creatures you control when damage would be dealt, including the equipped creature. Notably, if damage would be dealt to multiple creatures at the same time, you'll count the number of creatures you control before any of that damage is dealt.
2014/07/18: If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Dictate of the Twin Gods says, "If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead." Suppose the equipped creature would be dealt 3 damage while Dictate of the Twin Gods is on the battlefield and you control two creatures. You can either (a) prevent 2 damage first and then let Dictate of the Twin Gods's effect apply, for a result of the equipped creature being dealt 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent 2 damage, for a result of the creature being dealt 4 damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>383425</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> and either Blood Moon or Magus of the Moon are on the battlefield, all nonbasic lands will be Mountains, not Swamps. <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> will be a Mountain as well. It will have "{T}: Add {R}" and no other abilities.
2014/07/18: <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> isn't a Swamp while it's not on the battlefield.
2014/07/18: Urborg's ability causes each land on the battlefield to have the land type Swamp. Each land thus has the ability "{T}: Add {B}." Nothing else changes about those lands, including their names, other subtypes, other abilities, and whether they're legendary or basic.
2014/07/18: If Urborg loses its abilities (for example, if it becomes a creature and then Turn to Frog targets it), all lands on the battlefield, including Urborg, will still be Swamps, but Urborg won't have the ability "Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types." Urborg also won't be able to tap to produce {B}, but other lands (including those that enter the battlefield later in the turn) will. The way continuous effects work, Urborg's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes both the type-changing ability and its own mana ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: If <Garruk's Packleader> and another creature with power 3 or greater enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, the ability will trigger.
2012/07/01: The ability checks the power of each creature as it enters the battlefield. It will take into account counters the permanent enters the battlefield with and static abilities that affect its power (such as Flinthoof Boar's ability). After the creature is on the battlefield, raising its power with a spell (such as Titanic Growth), an activated ability, or a triggered ability won't cause this ability to retroactively trigger.
2012/07/01: The creature's power is checked only to see if the ability triggers. It doesn't matter what the creature's power is when the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Terra Stomper> can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Cancel). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter <Terra Stomper> won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.</Rulings>
