<Artist>Christopher Rush</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

<CardText>Champion an Elf (When this creature enters the battlefield, sacrifice it unless you exile another Elf you control. When this creature leaves the battlefield, that card returns to the battlefield.)

Wolves you control have deathtouch.</CardText>
<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: <Wren's Run Packmaster> gives deathtouch to all Wolf permanents you control, not just the tokens it creates.
2009/10/01: A Wolf's deathtouch ability will apply if both <Wren's Run Packmaster> and that Wolf are on the battlefield at the time the Wolf deals damage. The creature dealt damage by the Wolf will be destroyed the next time state-based actions are checked, even if the Wolf or <Wren's Run Packmaster> leaves the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Name>Door of Destinies</Name>
<Type>Artifact</Type>
<ManaCost>4 (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>As Door of Destinies enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.
Whenever you cast a spell of the chosen type, put a charge counter on Door of Destinies.
Creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1 for each charge counter on Door of Destinies.</CardText>
<Artist>Rob Alexander</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If you cast a creature spell of the chosen type, <Door of Destinies> will get a charge counter before the creature enters the battlefield. The creature will enter the battlefield with the additional boost to its power and toughness.
2013/07/01: Creature types, such as Human or Sliver, appear after the dash on the type line of creatures. Notably, artifact is not a creature type. A creature may have more than one creature type, such as Goblin Warrior. Such a creature would benefit from <Door of Destinies> if the chosen creature type was Goblin or Warrior.</Rulings>

<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: This ability triggers when you cast <Demigod of Revenge> as a spell. It won't trigger if <Demigod of Revenge> is put directly onto the battlefield.
2008/05/01: The triggered ability will resolve before <Demigod of Revenge> will.
2008/05/01: If <Demigod of Revenge> is countered *before* its triggered ability resolves, the ability will still resolve. It will return that <Demigod of Revenge> from your graveyard to the battlefield, as well as any others. If you're casting a spell to counter <Demigod of Revenge>, it's important to clarify you're casting it *after* the triggered ability resolves if you don't want that <Demigod of Revenge> to be put onto the battlefield.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: After you discard your hand and the number of creatures each opponent must sacrifice has been determined, each opponent in turn order, starting with the player whose turn it is if that player is your opponent, chooses which creatures they will sacrifice, then all the chosen creatures are all sacrificed at the same time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jean-Sébastien Rossbach</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Putting a token creature with devour onto the battlefield works the same as putting any other creature with devour onto the battlefield. The token may devour <Dragon Broodmother> itself!
2009/05/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Dragon Broodmother>'s second ability triggers only once at the beginning of each team's upkeep, not once for each player. You'll get one Dragon token at the beginning of your team's upkeep and one Dragon token at the beginning of the opposing team's upkeep.</Rulings>
