<Rulings>2018/12/07: <Containment Priest>'s last ability won't affect any creatures that were cast, including ones cast from unusual zones such as your graveyard.
2018/12/07: <Containment Priest>'s last ability doesn't stop creature tokens from entering the battlefield. It also doesn't affect creatures that were already on the battlefield.
2018/12/07: If a noncreature card wasn't cast and is entering the battlefield as a creature (due to an effect such as that of March of the Machines), it will be exiled. Similarly, if a creature card wasn't cast and is entering the battlefield as a noncreature permanent (for example, Heliod, God of the Sun with insufficient devotion), it won't be exiled.
2018/12/07: If <Containment Priest> enters the battlefield without being cast, its ability won't exile itself.
2018/12/07: If <Containment Priest> enters the battlefield at the same time as other creatures, its ability won't affect those creatures.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: If <Grasp of Fate> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no nonland permanents will be exiled.
2015/11/04: Auras attached to exiled nonland permanents will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on exiled nonland permanents will cease to exist.
2015/11/04: If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/11/04: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after <Grasp of Fate> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/11/04: In a multiplayer game, if <Grasp of Fate>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield.

Myriad (Whenever this creature attacks, for each opponent other than defending player, you may create a token that's a copy of this creature that's tapped and attacking that player or a planeswalker they control. Exile the tokens at end of combat.)</CardText>
<Artist>Nils Hamm</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: The tokens created by the myriad ability enter the battlefield tapped even though they'll have vigilance.
2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.
2015/11/04: If the defending player is your only opponent, no tokens are put onto the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You choose whether each token is attacking the player or a planeswalker they control as the token is created.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: Once a creature becomes monstrous, it can't become monstrous again. If <Kalemne's Captain> is already monstrous, the activated ability won't do anything.
2015/11/04: Monstrous isn't an ability that the creature has. It's just something true about that creature. If the creature stops being a creature or loses its abilities, it continues to be monstrous.

<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: If the third mode is chosen multiple times, each of those modes represents a separate life-gaining event. For example, if the third mode is chosen three times, and you control Karlov of the Ghost Council (a creature with the ability "Whenever you gain life, put two +1/+1 counters on Karlov of the Ghost Council."), Karlov's ability will trigger three times, for a total of six +1/+1 counters.
2015/11/04: You choose the modes as you cast the spell. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/11/04: If a mode requires a target, you can select that mode only if there's a legal target available. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes you don't choose. Each time you select that mode, you can choose a different target, or you can choose the same target.
2015/11/04: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of a Confluence in the order they are written. If the same mode is chosen more than once, you choose their relative order as you cast the spell.
2015/11/04: No player can cast spells or activate abilities in between the modes of a resolving spell.
2015/11/04: If a Confluence is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/11/04: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Confluence resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: <Aethersnatch> can target any spell, even one without targets.
2015/11/04: If you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell, it will be put into its owner's graveyard as it resolves.
2015/11/04: You may change any or none of the spell's targets. If you change a target, you must choose a legal target for the spell. If you can't, you must leave the target unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). Notably, if you were originally chosen as a "target opponent" for a spell you gain control with <Aethersnatch>, you are now an illegal target as you aren't your own opponent.
2015/11/04: Combat damage dealt by a commander is tracked without regard to who controlled the commander at the time it dealt damage. For example, say a commander deals 10 combat damage to a player, leaves the battlefield, is recast, and you gain control of it with <Aethersnatch>. If it deals another 11 combat damage to that same player, they will lose the game.

<Rulings>2015/11/04: The activated ability <Gigantoplasm> gives itself becomes part of its copiable values. Unless the ability is overwritten by another copy effect, a creature that's a copy of <Gigantoplasm> will have that ability.
2015/11/04: However, the effect of that ability isn't copiable. That is, if <Gigantoplasm> is a copy of a creature with base power and toughness 2/2 and you activate its ability making it a 4/4 creature, another creature that becomes a copy of <Gigantoplasm> will have base power and toughness 2/2.
2015/11/04: <Gigantoplasm> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, etc.
2015/11/04: If <Gigantoplasm> isn't a creature (perhaps because it copied a land that had temporarily become a creature), you can still activate the ability "{X}: This creature has base power and toughness X/X." However, this ability won't have any effect, and it won't turn <Gigantoplasm> into a creature.
2015/11/04: The activated ability overwrites all previous effects that set <Gigantoplasm>'s base power and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set its base power and/or toughness that start to apply after the ability resolves (including ones created by subsequent activations of the ability) will overwrite the effect of the ability.
2015/11/04: Effects that modify <Gigantoplasm>'s power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to <Gigantoplasm> no matter when they started applying. The same is true for counters that affect its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2015/11/04: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0. The ability that <Gigantoplasm> gives itself doesn't affect an {X} in its mana cost.
2015/11/04: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Gigantoplasm>), then <Gigantoplasm> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature was copying (plus any abilities it gained as part of the copy process, if applicable).
2015/11/04: If the chosen creature is a token, <Gigantoplasm> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Gigantoplasm> isn't a token, even if it's copying one.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Gigantoplasm> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If <Gigantoplasm> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Gigantoplasm> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<CardText>Cast this spell only during the declare blockers step.
For each creature attacking you or a planeswalker you control, create a token that's a copy of that creature and that's blocking that creature. Exile those tokens at end of combat.</CardText>
<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: A token created by <Mirror Match> will be blocking the creature it's copying even if that creature can't be blocked or has an ability that would stop the token creature from blocking it (such as menace or protection). This is also true even if the token creature has an ability that would stop it from being declared as a blocker.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield blocking, they were never declared as blockers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature blocks won't trigger. If there are any costs to have a creature block, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: If the tokens aren't creatures (perhaps because the attacking creature was an animated land), they'll enter the battlefield but they won't be blocking. Attacking creatures that weren't otherwise blocked will remain unblocked.
2015/11/04: The delayed triggered ability that exiles the tokens will trigger at end of combat no matter what happens to the original creature.
2015/11/04: If <Mirror Match> creates more than one token for any given attacking creature (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), each of those tokens will enter the battlefield blocking the creature it's a copy of. All of those tokens will be exiled by the delayed triggered ability.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2015/11/04: If the copied creature is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2015/11/04: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Mirror Match> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.</Rulings>

2015/11/04: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of a Confluence in the order they are written. If the same mode is chosen more than once, you choose their relative order as you cast the spell.
2015/11/04: No player can cast spells or activate abilities in between the modes of a resolving spell.
2015/11/04: If a Confluence is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/11/04: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Confluence resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

You keep playing.
2017/11/17: Other circumstances can still cause an opponent to lose the game, however. An opponent will lose a game if they concede, if that player is penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if that player's Magic Online® game clock runs out of time.
2017/11/17: Effects that say the game is a draw, such as the _Legends_(TM) card Divine Intervention, are not affected by <Abyssal Persecutor>.
2017/11/17: <Abyssal Persecutor> won't preclude an opponent's life total from reaching 0 or less. It will just preclude that player from losing the game as a result.

<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.
2015/11/04: If the defending player is your only opponent, no tokens are put onto the battlefield.

2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.

2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

Myriad (Whenever this creature attacks, for each opponent other than defending player, you may create a token that's a copy of this creature that's tapped and attacking that player or a planeswalker they control. Exile the tokens at end of combat.)</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.
2015/11/04: If the defending player is your only opponent, no tokens are put onto the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You choose whether each token is attacking the player or a planeswalker they control as the token is created.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

2015/11/04: If a mode requires a target, you can select that mode only if there's a legal target available. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes you don't choose. Each time you select that mode, you can choose a different target, or you can choose the same target.
2015/11/04: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of a Confluence in the order they are written. If the same mode is chosen more than once, you choose their relative order as you cast the spell.

<Artist>Alisa Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: Damage dealt to Anya is tracked even if Anya has indestructible. For example, if Anya is dealt what would be lethal damage and Anya loses indestructible (perhaps because each opponent's life total is too high), it will be destroyed the next time state-based actions are performed. However, the check for whether a creature dealt damage by a source with deathtouch is destroyed happens only the first time that state-based actions are performed after that damage-dealing event.
2015/11/04: If damage is dealt to Anya and to your opponents at the same time, Anya may gain indestructible and/or extra toughness before state-based actions are checked. Similarly, if damage is dealt to Anya by a source with lifelink controlled by an opponent, Anya may lose indestructible and/or toughness before state-based actions are checked.
2015/11/04: If a player's starting life total is odd (Commander Vanguard? Sweet.), half that player's life total will be a fraction, and that's okay. For example, if an opponent's starting life total is 41, half that number is 20 ½. If that player's life total is 20 or less, Anya will have indestructible.</Rulings>

<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: The power and toughness of the tokens will change as the number of experience counters you have does.
2015/11/04: The ability that defines the token's power and toughness is part of the token's copiable values. Copies of the token will also have that ability.
2015/11/04: Putting an enchantment creature token onto the battlefield won't cause Daxos's first ability to trigger. On the other hand, constellation abilities trigger whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, so those abilities will trigger.
2015/11/04: Experience counters are the second kind of counters a player can have, joining poison.
2015/11/04: All experience counters are identical, no matter how you got them. For example, the last ability will count experience counters that you got from the first ability, from another ability, from proliferating, and so on.
2015/11/04: Each game pack includes a card labeled "Experience" with the suggestion "Place your experience counters here." This card isn't required for play. It's simply a convenient spot to put your experience counters, which can be represented with dice, glass beads, or other small items.</Rulings>

2015/11/04: If the tokens aren't creatures (perhaps because the equipped creature was an animated land), they'll enter the battlefield but they won't be attacking. You'll still exile those tokens at end of combat.
2015/11/04: If the equipped creature is legendary, the tokens will all enter the battlefield. Then you'll choose one of them to remain on the battlefield. The others will be put into your graveyard. Any enters-the-battlefield or dies triggers of the tokens will work.
2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.
2015/11/04: If the defending player is your only opponent, no tokens are put onto the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You choose whether each token is attacking the player or a planeswalker they control as the token is created.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>6 (6)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Imprint — When Duplicant enters the battlefield, you may exile target nontoken creature.
As long as a card exiled with Duplicant is a creature card, Duplicant has the power, toughness, and creature types of the last creature card exiled with Duplicant. It's still a Shapeshifter.</CardText>
<Artist>Marco Nelor</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: If no creature card is imprinted on <Duplicant>, it has its normal power, toughness, and creature type.
2016/06/08: <Duplicant>'s base power and toughness change to the imprinted card's power and toughness. Counters and other effects that modify <Duplicant>'s power and toughness still apply.
2016/06/08: Abilities that define a creature's power and toughness apply while that card is in exile, but abilities that add or subtract from it don't. For example, the ability of Battle Squadron applies to determine <Duplicant>'s power and toughness, but the ability of Werebear doesn't. <Duplicant>'s power and toughness are constantly updated if the exiled card's power and/or toughness change.
2016/06/08: <Duplicant> keeps all creature types it had when the card was imprinted, including any types that <Duplicant> had gained.
2016/07/13: If a melded permanent is exiled by <Duplicant>'s triggered ability, that ability's controller chooses the relative timestamp of the two meld cards. <Duplicant> looks at the information of the one with the later timestamp.</Rulings>

Equip {3}</CardText>
<Artist>James Paick</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: <Scytheclaw>'s triggered ability triggers and resolves after combat damage is dealt. For example, if the Germ token deals 1 combat damage to a player with 10 life, combat damage will reduce that player's life total to 9. Then <Scytheclaw>'s ability will cause the player to lose 5 life, leaving the player at 4.
2015/11/04: Like other Equipment, each Equipment with living weapon has an equip cost. You can pay this cost to attach an Equipment to another creature you control. Once the Germ token is no longer equipped, it will be put into your graveyard and subsequently cease to exist, unless another effect raises its toughness above 0.</Rulings>

—Jace Beleren</Flavor>
<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: You must choose two different colors.
2015/11/04: <Seal of the Guildpact>'s last ability doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of any spell. It changes only the total cost you pay.
2015/11/04: <Seal of the Guildpact>'s last ability can't reduce the amount of colored mana you pay for a spell. It reduces only the generic component of that cost.
2015/11/04: If there are additional costs to cast a spell, or if the cost to cast a spell is increased by an effect (such as the one created by Thalia, Guardian of Thraben's ability), apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
2015/11/04: The cost reduction can apply to alternative costs such as evoke costs.
2015/11/04: If a spell you cast has {X} in its mana cost, you choose the value of X before calculating the spell's total cost. For example, if that spell's mana cost is {X}{R}{G} and you've chosen red and green, you could choose 5 as the value of X and pay {3}{R}{G} to cast the spell.</Rulings>
