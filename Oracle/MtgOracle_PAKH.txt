Embalm {5}{W} ({5}{W}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Angel with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Min Yum</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2017/04/18: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Angel of Sanctions> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2017/04/18: In a multiplayer game, if <Angel of Sanctions>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2017/04/18: If <Angel of Sanctions> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2017/04/18: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/04/18: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/04/18: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
2017/04/18: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves. You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: All of the tokens enter the battlefield simultaneously. They'll be created with the same name, color, type and subtype, abilities, power, toughness, and so on.
2017/04/18: If the token you create has any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities, first determine how many tokens are being created, then apply those abilities individually for each one. For example, if a token with "You may have [this permanent] enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield" would be created (such as an embalmed Vizier of Many Faces), the resulting two tokens can each copy a different creature.
2017/04/18: If an effect creates more than one kind of token, it'll create twice as many of each kind. For example, if you cast Bestial Menace while controlling <Anointed Procession>, you'll create two Snake tokens, two Wolf tokens, and two Elephant tokens.
2017/04/18: If you control two <Anointed Procession>s, then the number of tokens created is four times the original number. If you control three, then the number of tokens created is eight times the original number, and so on.
2017/04/18: If the effect creating the tokens instructs you to do something with those tokens at a later time, like exiling them at the end of combat, you'll do that for all the tokens.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. These cards have the Planeswalker symbol in their text box; this symbol has no effect on gameplay.

<Artist>Noah Bradley</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: A card that changes zones is considered a new object, so casting the same <Approach of the Second Sun> card on a later turn is "another spell" named <Approach of the Second Sun>.
2017/04/18: If you have fewer than six cards in your library, you'll put <Approach of the Second Sun> on the bottom of your library. Otherwise, you'll lift up the top six cards without looking at them and place <Approach of the Second Sun> just under them.
2017/04/18: The second <Approach of the Second Sun> that you cast must be cast from your hand, but first may have been cast from anywhere.
2017/04/18: A copy of a spell isn't cast, so it won't count as the first nor as the second <Approach of the Second Sun>.
2017/04/18: As your second <Approach of the Second Sun> resolves, it checks only whether the first one was cast, not whether the first one resolved. If your first <Approach of the Second Sun> was countered, you'll still win the game as your second one resolves.
2017/07/14: <Approach of the Second Sun> has no effect until it's resolving. If the second one you cast is countered, you won't win the game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Each search works exactly the same as normal except that the opponent doing the searching sees only the top four cards of that library. They can't look at the other cards in that library at all. Cards not in the top four cards of the library can't be found in the search, even if they're identifiable in some manner.
2017/04/18: For effects that check whether a player searched a library, searching the top four cards of that library counts as searching that library.
2017/04/18: If an effect uses the word "search" once but allows an opponent to search for multiple cards, the top four cards remain the same throughout the entire search. Finding one card won't cause the fifth card to be included in the search.
2017/04/18: After the search is complete, the entire library is shuffled.</Rulings>

<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: Gideon's first ability will continue to prevent damage dealt by the target permanent even if Gideon leaves the battlefield before your next turn.
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
2017/04/18: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2017/04/18: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
2017/04/18: If Gideon leaves the battlefield after giving you his emblem, you'll keep the emblem. Its effect will apply again later if another Gideon comes under your control.
2017/04/18: No game effect can cause you to lose the game or cause any opponent to win the game while Gideon's emblem is in effect. It doesn't matter whether you have 0 or less life, you're forced to draw a card while your library is empty, you have ten or more poison counters, you're at your Glorious End, your opponent casts a second Approach of the Second Sun, or so on. You keep playing.
2017/04/18: Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your Magic Online® game clock runs out of time.
2017/04/18: If you have Gideon's emblem in a Two-Headed Giant game and control a Gideon planeswalker, your team can't lose the game and the opposing team can't win the game. If your teammate controls a Gideon planeswalker but you do not, your emblem's effect doesn't apply.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: You must choose the name of a card, not the name of a token. For example, you can't choose "Zombie" or "Ragavan." However, if a token happens to have the same name as a card (such as an embalmed creature token), you can choose it.

<Artist>Tommy Arnold</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If you cast a card for an alternative cost of {0}, you can't pay any other alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/04/18: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/04/18: If a spell has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0. You can cast it with <As Foretold>'s alternative cost.
2017/04/18: If you're casting a split card, only the converted mana cost of the half you're casting is compared to the number of time counters on <As Foretold>. This is because only that half is on the stack at the time that you choose to apply the effect of <As Foretold>.
2017/04/18: If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it for another cost that doesn't include X. For example, if there are five time counters on <As Foretold> and you choose to use its effect to cast Pull from Tomorrow, X must be 0. X can't be 2, even though the spell's converted mana cost would be 4.
2017/04/18: If you control multiple <As Foretold>s, you may cast one spell for each of them paying {0}.
2017/04/18: All counters with the same name are indistinguishable from other counters with that name. Cards from the Time Spiral block that interact with time counters will interact with <As Foretold>.</Rulings>

Embalm {3}{U}{U}</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/04/18: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Vizier of Many Faces>), then <Vizier of Many Faces> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2017/04/18: If the chosen creature is a token, <Vizier of Many Faces> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Vizier of Many Faces> is not a token in this case unless it's embalmed.
2017/04/18: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Vizier of Many Faces> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2017/04/18: <Vizier of Many Faces> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
2017/04/18: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/04/18: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/04/18: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/04/18: If <Vizier of Many Faces> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Vizier of Many Faces> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2017/04/18: The characteristics <Vizier of Many Faces> gains as part of its copy effect are copiable values that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves. You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: <Combat Celebrant>'s ability untaps all of your creatures, not just the ones that are attacking.
2017/04/18: Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
2017/04/18: There's no main phase between your combat phases, so you'll have no opportunity to cast spells or activate abilities that could only be cast any time you could cast a sorcery. For example, you won't be able to cast another creature or equip Equipment between combats.
2017/04/18: If you exert <Combat Celebrant>, you get an additional combat phase even if <Combat Celebrant> doesn't survive the first combat phase.
2017/04/18: If you exert multiple <Combat Celebrant>s in one combat phase, you'll have that many additional combat phases, but all of your creatures are untapped only during the current combat phase. You'll need to exert the <Combat Celebrant>s one at a time, in multiple combat phases, to untap your attacking creatures and attack with them in each combat step.
2017/04/18: You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.
2017/04/18: If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set.

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: Ending the turn this way means the following things happen in order: 1) All spells and abilities on the stack are exiled. This includes spells and abilities that can't be countered. 2) If there are any attacking and blocking creatures, they're removed from combat. 3) State-based actions are checked. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. 5) The cleanup step happens in its entirety.
2017/04/18: If any triggered abilities do trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn is over.
2017/04/18: Though other spells and abilities that are exiled won't get a chance to resolve, they don't count as being countered.
2017/04/18: Any "at the beginning of the next end step" triggered abilities won't get the chance to trigger that turn because the end step is skipped. Those abilities will trigger at the beginning of the end step of the next turn.
2017/04/18: If <Glorious End>'s delayed triggered ability is countered, it won't trigger again. The same is true if it's removed from the stack in any other way (such as by a second even more <Glorious End>) or if it resolves and you don't lose the game (perhaps because of the emblem of Gideon of the Trials).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: <Heart-Piercer Manticore> features a new style of triggered ability. When it enters the battlefield, its triggered ability goes on the stack without a target.

This is different from other abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities before a creature is sacrificed and then again after the creature is sacrificed but before damage is dealt.
2017/04/18: <Heart-Piercer Manticore>'s damage-dealing ability triggers only when you sacrifice a creature as a result of the instruction of its triggered ability. It won't trigger if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.
2017/04/18: For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Amonkhet booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
2017/04/18: The sacrificed creature's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its power.
2017/04/18: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/04/18: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/04/18: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/04/18: You can't sacrifice multiple creatures to deal damage multiple times.
2017/07/14: If a spell or ability puts a creature card with embalm into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately after that spell or ability resolves. You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If an effect causes a creature you control to fight a creature an opponent controls, the damage is dealt simultaneously. For instance, if your 2/2 creature fights an opponent's 4/4 creature, your creature will be dealt 4 damage and your opponent's creature will have two -1/-1 counters put on it.
2017/04/18: If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes a source you control to deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, that damage will be replaced with -1/-1 counters.
2017/04/18: <Soul-Scar Mage>'s effect isn't a prevention effect. Damage that can't be prevented will be replaced with -1/-1 counters.
2017/04/18: If multiple prevention and/or replacement effects are trying to apply to the same damage, the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order in which to apply them. As examples, an opponent could choose to apply the effect of Djeru's Resolve and prevent the damage rather than put -1/-1 counters on it; or an opponent could choose to convert the damage to -1/-1 counters before Insult could double it, and then Insult's effect won't apply anymore.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: All attackers are chosen at once. You can't attack with <Champion of Rhonas>, put a creature card onto the battlefield, and then attack with that creature.
2017/04/18: If the creature put onto the battlefield has any abilities that trigger when creatures attack or when you exert creatures, those abilities won't trigger.
2017/04/18: You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.
2017/04/18: If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set. You can't do so later in combat, and creatures put onto the battlefield attacking can't be exerted.

<Artist>Victor Adame Minguez</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: <Vizier of the Menagerie> lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2017/04/18: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2017/04/18: Normally, <Vizier of the Menagerie> allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it any time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
2017/04/18: You may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast any creature spell, not just creature spells that you cast from the top of your library.
2017/04/18: You'll still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs such as emerge or that of As Foretold.
2017/04/18: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

<CardText>Aftermath (Cast this spell only from your graveyard. Then exile it.)
Each player shuffles their hand and graveyard into their library, then draws seven cards.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Alexander Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If a spell is put into its owner's library, it's removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn't countered; it just no longer exists. This works against a spell that can't be countered.
2017/04/18: If a copy of a spell or a token is put into its owner's library, it's moved there, then it will cease to exist as a state-based action.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: If the target's owner's library contains no cards, the target spell or permanent will be put into that player's library as the only card.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: Any damage dealt by a creature you control with lifelink causes you to gain that much life, not just combat damage.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: If either or both targets are illegal when <Fight> tries to resolve, no creature will deal or be dealt damage.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: If you choose the name of a split card, you choose one name, not both. For example, you could name Failure or <Comply>, but not Failure // <Comply>. Opponents are still allowed to cast the half you didn't choose.

<Rulings>2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: You don't have to choose the same value for X while casting <Earth> as you did while casting Heaven.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
