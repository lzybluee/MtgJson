<Rulings>2017/11/17: You choose how many targets <Bogardan Hellkite>'s triggered ability has and how the damage is divided as you put the ability onto the stack. Each target must receive at least 1 damage.
2017/11/17: If some of the creatures or players are illegal targets as <Bogardan Hellkite>'s triggered ability tries to resolve, the original division of damage still applies and the damage that would have been dealt to the illegal targets is lost. It won't be dealt instead to a legal target.</Rulings>

<Artist>Sam Wood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>178018</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The first three times <Dragon Whelp>'s ability is activated in a turn will do nothing other than give it +1/+0 until end of turn. Any subsequent activations will also cause its delayed triggered ability to trigger. That means if you activate <Dragon Whelp>'s ability five times, for example, two different delayed triggered abilities will trigger at the beginning of the next end step and cause you to sacrifice <Dragon Whelp>.
2009/10/01: If the fourth (or more) time <Dragon Whelp>'s ability is activated during the same turn happens to be during that turn's end step, the delayed triggered ability won't trigger until the beginning of the next turn's end step. You'll have to sacrifice <Dragon Whelp> at that time.</Rulings>
