<Artist>Susan Van Camp</Artist>
<Multiverseid>937</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You lose control of the creature if the Old Man leaves the battlefield. This is because it is no longer tapped.
2009/10/01: If <Old Man of the Sea> stops being tapped before its ability resolves — even if it becomes tapped again right away — you won't gain control of the targeted creature at all. The same is true if the targeted creature's power becomes greater than <Old Man of the Sea>'s power before the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: The ability doesn't care whether <Old Man of the Sea> remains under your control, only that <Old Man of the Sea> remains tapped and its power remains large enough. If an opponent gains control of <Old Man of the Sea>, you'll keep control of the affected creature (until <Old Man of the Sea> stops being tapped or it no longer has enough power).
2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the targeted permanent remains a legal target for the ability, only that it's on the battlefield and its power remains small enough. The effect will continue to apply to it even if it gains shroud, stops being a creature, or would no longer be a legal target for any other reason. If it stops being a creature, its power is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

<CardText>Banding (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)
As long as Camel is attacking, prevent all damage Deserts would deal to Camel and to creatures banded with Camel.</CardText>

<Multiverseid>971</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: It does prevent damage from animated Deserts in combat.
2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/09/16: If <Oubliette> leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted creature forever.
