<Rulings>2007/02/01: If <Akroma, Angel of Fury> is cast face down, it can be countered.
2007/02/01: <Akroma, Angel of Fury> and Akroma, Angel of Wrath do not have the same name, so the legend rule does not apply.
2013/07/01: In a Commander game where this card is your commander, you may cast it face-down from the Command zone by paying {3} plus {2} for each time it has been cast from your command zone. The cost to turn it face-up is unaffected.
2018/03/16: The "legend rule" cares about legendary permanents with the exact same English name. You can control <Akroma, Angel of Fury> and Akroma, Angel of Wrath at the same time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: <Archangel of Strife>'s second and third abilities are linked. Similarly, its second and fourth abilities are linked. The bonus a player's creatures get depends only on the choice that player made when <Archangel of Strife> entered the battlefield.
2011/09/22: The active player chooses war or peace first, followed by each other player in turn order. Each player will know what previous players chose when making their choice.
2011/09/22: <Archangel of Strife>'s bonuses apply immediately. Depending on your choice, <Archangel of Strife> will enter the battlefield as either a 9/6 or 6/9 creature.
2011/09/22: If there are two Archangels of Strife on the battlefield, and you choose war for one and peace for the other, your creatures get +3/+3.
2011/09/22: As soon as <Archangel of Strife> leaves the battlefield, the bonus stops applying. If it returns to the battlefield, players will be able to make new choices.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: A permanent with indestructible can't be destroyed, but it can still be sacrificed, exiled, put into a graveyard, and so on. Notably, a permanent with indestructible can be put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule."
2017/11/17: Creatures with indestructible still have damage marked on them, even though that damage won't destroy them. If Avacyn leaves the battlefield, creatures that lose indestructible and have lethal damage marked on them will be destroyed.

2009/10/01: Once the color is chosen, it's too late for opponents to respond by casting spells of that color. Iona is not yet in the battlefield at the time the color is chosen, so, for example, there's no way for an opponent to destroy it by casting Doom Blade if the chosen color is black.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: No game effect can cause you to lose the game or cause any opponent to win the game while you control <Platinum Angel>. It doesn't matter whether you have 0 or less life, you're forced to draw a card while your library is empty, you have ten or more poison counters, you're dealt combat damage by Phage the Untouchable, your opponent has Mortal Combat with twenty or more creature cards in their graveyard, or so on. You keep playing.
2009/10/01: Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game, however. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your _Magic Online_(R) game clock runs out of time.
2009/10/01: If you control <Platinum Angel> in a Two-Headed Giant game, your team can't lose the game and the opposing team can't win the game.</Rulings>
