<Multiverseid>3294</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The loss of life from targeting this card does not work until after this card enters the battlefield, so you can counter it without losing life.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes life gain (like Invigorate's alternative cost does), that cost can't be paid.
2008/05/01: Effects that would replace gaining life with some other effect won't be able to do anything because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2008/05/01: Effects that replace an event with gaining life (like Words of Worship's effect does) will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2008/05/01: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number, and that number is higher than your current life total, that effect will normally cause you to gain life equal to the difference. With <Forsaken Wastes> on the battlefield, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than your current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2008/10/01: This has the supertype world. When a world permanent enters the battlefield, any world permanents that were already on the battlefield are put into their owners' graveyards. This is a state-based action called the "world rule." The new world permanent stays on the battlefield. If two world permanents enter the battlefield at the same time, they're both put into their owners' graveyards.</Rulings>

This means that if <Barreling Attack> is cast after blockers are declared, the targeted creature will gain trample but won't be able to get +1/+1 because it's too late for the ability to trigger (unless there is another combat phase in the turn).</Rulings>

<CardText>Lands you control are Plains.
Nonland permanents you control are white. The same is true for spells you control and nonland cards you own that aren't on the battlefield.
You may spend white mana as though it were mana of any color. You may spend other mana only as though it were colorless mana.</CardText>
<Artist>Liz Danforth</Artist>
<Multiverseid>3481</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The effect to turn all your non-land cards (including artifacts) white is the effect of a static ability. Thus, a color change on a permanent prior to <Celestial Dawn> entering the battlefield will be overridden by <Celestial Dawn>'s effect.
2004/10/04: <Celestial Dawn> does not change the type of lands which are not on the battlefield. Lands not on the battlefield are what they say they are.
2004/10/04: Will not add or remove Snow Supertype from a land.
2004/10/04: You may use a different color mana than the color required for spells and abilities that require a specific color. If you do, and the spell or ability checks the actual color of the mana, it can tell the difference.
2004/10/04: If you pay white mana to activate an ability that can only be activated by spending another color of mana, then any limitations on activating the ability (such as the number of times it can be activated each turn) still apply as if you spent the proper color.
2004/10/04: <Celestial Dawn> no longer changes mana symbols on cards.
2006/09/25: Mana produced by spells you control and nonland permanents you control isn't affected by <Celestial Dawn>. Llanowar Elves will produce {G}, for example. However, any colored mana may be spent only on the colorless part of costs.
2006/09/25: Land cards you own that aren't on the battlefield aren't changed to Plains.
2006/09/25: If you have nonwhite mana in your mana pool when <Celestial Dawn> enters the battlefield, it remains there but you can spend it only on the colorless part of costs.
2006/09/25: If you use a text-changing effect such as Mind Bend on <Celestial Dawn> to change the word "Plains" to a different land type, your lands are all of that new land type, and they will produce mana of the appropriate color for that type.
2006/09/25: If a permanent enters the battlefield while <Celestial Dawn> is on the battlefield, and then <Celestial Dawn> leaves the battlefield, the permanent's color will revert to the colors in its mana cost.
2017/09/29: If a nonbasic land has an ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped, it will lose that ability before it applies. The same is also true of any other abilities that modify how a land enters the battlefield or apply "as" a land enters the battlefield, such as the first ability of Cavern of Souls. This is a change from previous rulings.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you have more than one <Soul Echo>, the opponent chooses which ones will be replacing damage that turn (if any). And when damage happens, you decide which one of the ones the opponent selected that you want the damage to be replaced with, but the damage all goes to one of them.
2004/10/04: If this card runs out of counters before your next upkeep, the effect still replaces the damage and uselessly tries to remove counters from the now empty card.
2004/10/04: In a multi-player game, you choose a new opponent during each of your upkeeps.
2004/10/04: If you take damage between the start of the upkeep step and the time in which the upkeep trigger resolves, then <Soul Echo> will not affect that damage and you will be affected by the damage as normal.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The sacrifices are simultaneous, not one at a time.
2004/10/04: Phasing in does not trigger "enters the battlefield" abilities, so you don't have to sacrifice again if it phases in.
2007/07/15: Reverted to its original wording, this now has an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability. During resolution of the triggered ability, you choose one option or the other.
2007/07/15: If the Dreadnought is no longer on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves, you may still choose either option.
2013/04/15: If you are unable to sacrifice 12 power worth of creatures, then you cannot choose that option; in that case, you must sacrifice <Phyrexian Dreadnought>.</Rulings>
