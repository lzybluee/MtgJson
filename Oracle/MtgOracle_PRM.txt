<CardText>Copy target instant or sorcery spell, except that the copy is red. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Amy Weber</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: <Fork> will not copy changes made by modifying effects to the spell prior to the use of <Fork>, such as text-changing effects.
2004/10/04: If mana or other costs need to be spent at resolution of the spell, the player of <Fork> would still be responsible for paying that cost.
2004/10/04: You need not (and may not) pay any additional mana or other costs (like sacrifices) to use the spell which is <Fork>ed. You get control over a complete copy but can change nothing except the targets.
2004/10/04: <Fork> does not let you make non-targeting choices about the spell.
2004/10/04: When a spell with additional costs is copied, you don't have to pay those costs again.
2004/10/04: If you copy a spell for which Buyback has been paid, you get nothing back since the copied spell does not have a card to give you.
2004/10/04: The copy that is placed on the stack is not considered to have been "cast".
2004/10/04: The <Fork> card goes to the graveyard when it resolves and leaves the copy on the stack. There is no card representing the copy on the stack.
2004/10/04: It does copy the mana symbols in the mana cost for the card it is copying, but it uses its own color definition and not the one from those mana symbols. This is so it maintains its color just like the text says.
2004/10/04: If the spell being copied targets a spell on the stack, it is possible to target <Fork> itself since <Fork> is still on the stack when you pick the target(s) for the copy. Note that the copy's target will be illegal when it resolves.
2004/10/04: For spells that can have a variable number of targets, the controller of the copy must use the same number of targets the original spell did.
2004/10/04: <Fork>ing a spell with an X in the cost requires you to use the same X value.
2004/12/01: If you <Fork> a Spliced spell, the spliced text is added during the announcement of the original spell, and therefore is fully copied by <Fork>.
2009/05/01: The copy will have the same mana cost as the original spell, but will be red rather than whatever color that mana cost would have made it.
2009/10/01: If the targeted spell was kicked, then the copy will be kicked as well. If the targeted spell was not kicked, then the copy will not be kicked.</Rulings>

{T}: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Kaja Foglio & Phil Foglio</Artist>
<Rulings>2005/08/01: If another player takes control of the Factory while it is animated, that player keeps control until the control effect ends. They do not lose control just because the card stops being an Assembly-Worker. Note that Auras which steal cards will go to the graveyard if the permanent they enchant is no longer valid.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
2016/06/08: Once turned into a creature, <Mishra's Factory>'s last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.
2016/06/08: If you turn <Mishra's Factory> into a creature but haven't controlled it continuously since your most recent turn began, you won't be able to activate its first or last ability.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>4 (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>You may choose not to untap Tawnos's Coffin during your untap step.
{3}, {T}: Exile target creature and all Auras attached to it. Note the number and kind of counters that were on that creature. When Tawnos's Coffin leaves the battlefield or becomes untapped, return that exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control tapped with the noted number and kind of counters on it. If you do, return the other exiled cards to the battlefield under their owner's control attached to that permanent.</CardText>
<Artist>Christopher Rush</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The creature returns to the battlefield tapped. It does not return to the battlefield and then tap afterwards.
2007/09/16: If the targeted creature is a token, it will cease to exist after being exiled. Any Auras that were attached to it will remain exiled forever.
2007/09/16: If the exiled card is returned to the battlefield and, for some reason, it now can't be enchanted by an Aura that was also exiled by <Tawnos's Coffin>, that Aura will remain exiled.
2007/09/16: If <Tawnos's Coffin> leaves the battlefield before its ability has resolved, it will exile the targeted creature forever, since its delayed triggered ability will never trigger.
2008/04/01: Because the new wording doesn't use phasing, the exiled card will suffer from summoning sickness upon its return to the battlefield.
2008/04/01: The effect doesn't care what types the card has after it is exiled, only that it have been a creature while on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<CardText>At the beginning of your draw step, you may draw two additional cards. If you do, choose two cards in your hand drawn this turn. For each of those cards, pay 4 life or put the card on top of your library.</CardText>
<Artist>Harold McNeill</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: You always perform your normal draw before this ability. The normal draw occurs before anything can be placed on the stack during a player's draw step.
2016/06/08: If you control other triggered abilities that allow you to draw cards during your draw step, you can choose to order <Sylvan Library>'s ability before or after those abilities. Triggered abilities controlled by other players will resolve before triggered abilities you control.
2016/06/08: Any cards drawn prior to <Sylvan Library>'s ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to <Sylvan Library>'s triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. <Sylvan Library>'s controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand.
2016/06/08: If you control more than one <Sylvan Library>, the triggered ability of each will resolve in sequence. You don't get to draw all the cards at once and then put them all back at once.
2016/06/08: You can put back zero, one, or two cards.
2016/06/08: If you choose to draw two cards, then replace one or more of those draws with some other effect, the rest of <Sylvan Library>'s ability still happens. If you've actually drawn only one card that turn, you must choose that card and either pay 4 life or put it on top of your library. If you haven't actually drawn any cards that turn, the rest of the ability has no effect.
2016/06/08: It's not possible to take any actions between drawing the cards and choosing two cards. You can't cast the cards you drew to avoid having two cards to choose.</Rulings>

{T}: For as long as Preacher remains tapped, gain control of target creature of an opponent's choice they control.</CardText>
<Artist>Quinton Hoover</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The target of the ability is a creature the chosen opponent controls. As the ability resolves, if the target isn't a creature controlled by the chosen opponent, the ability won't resolve. If the ability's target is changed somehow, the new target must be a creature controlled by the chosen opponent.
2007/09/16: Whether <Preacher> is tapped is checked continually, starting when the ability is activated. If, before the ability resolves, there's any point at which <Preacher> is untapped, the ability has no effect — even if <Preacher> is tapped again by the time the ability resolves.
2007/09/16: When you activate the ability, you choose an opponent, then that opponent chooses the target.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Hazezon Tamar enters the battlefield, create X 1/1 Sand Warrior creature tokens that are red, green, and white at the beginning of your next upkeep, where X is the number of lands you control at that time.

<Artist>Richard Kane Ferguson</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: When <Hazezon Tamar>'s second ability resolves, all permanents with both the Sand and Warrior creature types are exiled, not just the Sand Warrior creature tokens it created. Permanents that have just one of those types are unaffected.
2009/10/01: The first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of your next upkeep. It doesn't matter who controls <Hazezon Tamar> at that time, or even if it's on the battlefield. The player who put Hazezon onto the battlefield gets the Sand Warriors.
2009/10/01: Only Sand Warriors that are actually on the battlefield when <Hazezon Tamar> leaves the battlefield are affected when its second ability resolves. If Hazezon leaves the battlefield after the delayed triggered ability created by its first ability triggers but before that ability resolves, its second ability triggers and resolves first, then the Sand Warriors are put on the battlefield. Those Sand Warriors will remain on the battlefield indefinitely.</Rulings>

2009/02/01: Plainscycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Plainscycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Plainscycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Plainscycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Plainscycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<Rulings>2007/10/01: Doran's ability means, for example, that a 2/3 creature will assign 3 damage in combat instead of 2.
2007/10/01: Doran's ability doesn't actually change creatures' power; it changes only the value of the combat damage they assign. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values.
2007/10/01: This effect is mandatory and affects all creatures.</Rulings>

<CardText>This spell costs {1} more to cast for each target beyond the first.
Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among any number of targets.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<CardText>Suspend 3—{0} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, pay {0} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
{T}, Sacrifice Lotus Bloom: Add three mana of any one color.</CardText>
<Artist>Christopher Rush</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

However, if <Figure of Destiny> is an 8/8 Kithkin Spirit Warrior Avatar with flying and first strike, and you activate its first ability, it will become a 2/2 Kithkin Spirit that still has flying and first strike.
2008/08/01: You can activate <Figure of Destiny>'s second and third abilities regardless of what creature types it is.

It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves.

<CardText>When Selkie Hedge-Mage enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Forests, you may gain 3 life.

<Artist>Brandon Kitkouski</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/08/01: Each of the triggered abilities has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you control two or more lands of the appropriate land type when the Hedge-Mage enters the battlefield, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you don't control two or more lands of the appropriate land type by the time it resolves.
2008/08/01: Both abilities trigger at the same time. You can put them on the stack in any order.
2008/08/01: Each of the triggered abilities look at your lands individually. This means that if you only control two dual-lands of the appropriate types, both of the abilities will trigger.
2008/08/01: Both abilities are optional; you choose whether to use them when they resolve. If an ability has a target, you must choose a target even if you don't plan to use the ability.</Rulings>

<Artist>Brian Despain</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: If <Isochron Scepter> leaves the battlefield while the activated ability is on the stack, the ability can still make a copy.
2016/06/08: You cast the copy while the ability is resolving and still on the stack.
2016/06/08: If the imprinted card leaves the exile zone while the activated ability is on the stack, the copy can't be made.
2016/06/08: If the exiled card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
2016/06/08: If you don't want to cast the copy, you can choose not to; the copy ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked.
2016/06/08: Because you're already casting the spell using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. When you activate the second ability, you may choose to cast either half of the split card, but you may not cast both halves.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Flame Javelin> is red even if you spend six green mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Flame Javelin> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {R}{R}{R} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Flame Javelin> by spending {R}{R}{R}, {2}{R}{R}, {4}{R}, or {6}.</Rulings>

Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may create a 4/4 green Beast creature token.</CardText>
<Flavor>"When the land is angry, so are they." -Nissa Revane</Flavor>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2009/10/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>

{T}: Add {R}.</CardText>
<Artist>James Paick</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle>'s triggered ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless, at the time a Mountain enters the battlefield under your control, you control five or more Mountains other than that new one, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you control fewer than five Mountains other than that new one by the time it resolves.
2009/10/01: If a Mountain you control leaves the battlefield between the time Valakut's second ability triggers and the time it resolves, be aware if that was the Mountain that caused Valakut's ability to trigger or not. If it was, Valakut's count isn't affected; if it wasn't, Valakut's count goes down by one.
2009/10/01: If multiple Mountains enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, Valakut's second ability could trigger that many times. Each ability takes into consideration the other Mountains that entered the battlefield at the same time as the one that caused it to trigger.
2009/10/01: You target a permanent or player when the ability triggers. You decide whether to have Valakut deal damage to that permanent or player as the ability resolves.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want <Comet Storm> to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.

They do not lose control just because the card stops being an Assembly-Worker. Note that Auras which steal cards will go to the graveyard if the permanent they enchant is no longer valid.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
2016/06/08: Once turned into a creature, <Mishra's Factory>'s last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.
2016/06/08: If you turn <Mishra's Factory> into a creature but haven't controlled it continuously since your most recent turn began, you won't be able to activate its first or last ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

Madness {R} (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</CardText>
<Artist>Ben Wootten</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

2007/05/01: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a graveyard from anywhere other than the battlefield, that ability triggers from the graveyard, (such as Krosan Tusker, Narcomoeba, or Quagnoth, for example). <Yixlid Jailer> will prevent those abilities from triggering at all.
2007/05/01: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a hidden zone from a graveyard, that ability triggers from the graveyard, (such as Golgari Brownscale), <Yixlid Jailer> will prevent that ability from triggering.
2007/05/01: Some replacement effects cause a card to be put somewhere else instead of being put into a graveyard (such as Legacy Weapon). These effects mean the card is never actually put into the graveyard, so <Yixlid Jailer> can't affect it.
2007/05/01: Some cards have abilities that modify how they're put onto the battlefield. For example, Scarwood Treefolk says "Scarwood Treefolk is put onto the battlefield tapped" and Triskelion says "Triskelion enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it." Although these cards won't have these abilities in the graveyard, they will be applied if the cards are put onto the battlefield from the graveyard (due to Zombify, perhaps). What matters is that these cards will have these abilities on the battlefield.
2007/05/01: If Mistform Ultimus is in the graveyard, the Ultimus will lose its ability that says "Mistform Ultimus is every creature type," but it will still *be* all creature types. The way continuous effects work, Mistform Ultimus's type-changing ability is applied before <Yixlid Jailer>'s ability removes it.</Rulings>

Persist (When this creature dies, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a -1/-1 counter on it.)</CardText>
<Artist>Larry MacDougall</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Artist>Michael Bruinsma</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/05/01: The triggered ability acts as a cycle-triggered ability or as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, as appropriate. The player who controls the triggered ability is the player who cycled the Sojourner, or the player who last controlled the Sojourner on the battlefield.
2009/05/01: If you cycle this card, the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2009/05/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.

2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chuck Lukacs</Artist>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: If <Oblivion Ring> leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted nonland permanent forever.
2007/10/01: If there are no nonland permanents on the battlefield other than an <Oblivion Ring>, and the card it exiled was another <Oblivion Ring>, casting a third <Oblivion Ring> will result in an involuntary infinite loop that will end the game in a draw (unless someone chooses to break it by putting another nonland permanent onto the battlefield or destroying one of the <Oblivion Ring>s, for example).
2008/10/01: If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything, but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled forever.
2012/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: If a spell with split second is on the stack, you can still respond by turning this creature face up and targeting that spell with the trigger. This is because split second only stops players from casting spells or activating abilities, while turning a creature face up is a special action.
2018/03/16: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Willbender>'s triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.

Forestcycling {2} ({2}, Discard this card: Search your library for a Forest card, reveal it, and put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.)</CardText>
<Artist>Matt Cavotta</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Forestcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Forest card. After you find a Forest card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>

<CardText>Each player chooses a number of lands they control equal to the number of lands controlled by the player who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players discard cards and sacrifice creatures the same way.</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary creature with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.
2010/06/15: The last ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step, before blockers are declared.
2010/06/15: In a multiplayer game, the only player affected by the last ability is the one <Lord of Shatterskull Pass> is attacking (or the one who controls the planeswalker <Lord of Shatterskull Pass> is attacking).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before they declare blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
2018/12/07: Emrakul's second ability triggers as you cast it, and that ability resolves before the spell itself. It resolves even if that spell is somehow removed from the stack.
2018/12/07: Emrakul can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Countersquall). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2018/12/07: "Colored spells" is not synonymous with "colored cards." For example, even though creatures are spells when they're cast, they're not spells when they're on the battlefield and can block Emrakul; and triggered abilities of permanents entering the battlefield (such as that of Banishing Light) can target it.
2018/12/07: Emrakul can't be the target of colored Aura spells, but colored Auras can be put onto the battlefield enchanting it.</Rulings>

<CardText>{T}: Choose two target blocking creatures an opponent controls. If each of those creatures could block all creatures that the other is blocking, remove both of them from combat. Each one then blocks all creatures the other was blocking.
Whenever Sorrow's Path becomes tapped, it deals 2 damage to you and each creature you control.</CardText>
<Artist>Randy Asplund-Faith</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: This has two abilities. The second ability triggers any time it becomes tapped, whether to pay for its ability or not.
2009/10/01: When <Sorrow's Path>'s first ability is activated, its second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of the first ability. The second ability resolves first, and may cause some of the attacking creatures to be dealt lethal damage.
2009/10/01: The first ability can target any two blocking creatures a single opponent controls. Whether those creatures could block all creatures the other is blocking isn't determined until the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: A "blocking creature" is one that has been declared as a blocker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield blocking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be a blocking creature through the end of combat step, even if the creature or creatures that it was blocking are no longer on the battlefield or have otherwise left combat by then.
2009/10/01: Abilities that trigger whenever one of the targeted creatures blocks will trigger when the first ability resolves, because those creatures will change from not blocking (since they're removed from combat) to blocking. It doesn't matter if those abilities triggered when those creatures blocked the first time. Abilities that trigger whenever one of the attacking creatures becomes blocked will not trigger again, because they never stopped being blocked creatures. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature blocks one of the attacking creatures will trigger again, though; those kinds of abilities trigger once for each creature that blocks.
2009/10/01: When determining whether a creature could block all creatures the other is blocking, take into account evasion abilities (like flying), protection abilities, and other blocking restrictions, as well as abilities that allow a creature to block multiple creatures or block as though a certain condition were true. Take into account whether those creatures are tapped, but not whether they have costs to block (since those apply only as blockers are declared).
2009/10/01: When the first ability resolves, if all the creatures that one of the targeted creatures was blocking have left combat, then the other targeted creature is considered to be able to block all creatures the first creature is blocking. If the ability has its full effect, the second creature will be removed from combat but not returned to combat; it doesn't block anything.</Rulings>

2010/08/15: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2010/08/15: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

2018/12/07: If the target permanent becomes an illegal target for <Maelstrom Pulse>, the spell doesn't resolve. Nothing is destroyed.
2018/12/07: The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types it was created with unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name.

Suspend 1—{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {R} and exile it with a time counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Daniel Ljunggren</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

2011/01/01: It doesn't matter who controlled those permanents at the time <Steel Hellkite> dealt combat damage, or if those permanents were even on the battlefield at that time.
2011/01/01: You may activate the last ability even if <Steel Hellkite> hasn't dealt combat damage to any players that turn. If you do, the ability won't do anything.
2011/01/01: If <Steel Hellkite>'s third ability is activated with X equal to 0, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0 the appropriate players control.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

If the number of Faeries you control has decreased enough in that time to make the target illegal, <Spellstutter Sprite>'s ability won't resolve (and the targeted spell will resolve as normal).</Rulings>

2010/03/01: Once the spell resolves, having a land enter the battlefield under your control provides no further benefit.
2010/03/01: The effect of this spell's landfall ability replaces its normal effect. If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, only the landfall-based effect happens.
2010/03/01: You must choose two targets as you cast <Searing Blaze>: a player and a creature that player controls. If you can't (because there are no creatures on the battlefield, perhaps), then you can't cast the spell.

<CardText>({UP} can be paid with either {U} or 2 life.)
You may have Phyrexian Metamorph enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact or creature on the battlefield, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types.</CardText>
<Artist>Jung Park</Artist>
<Watermark>Phyrexian</Watermark>
<Rulings>2011/06/01: A card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in that mana cost, regardless of how that cost may have been paid.
2011/06/01: To calculate the converted mana cost of a card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, count each Phyrexian mana symbol as 1.
2011/06/01: As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.
2011/06/01: If you're at 1 life or less, you can't pay 2 life.
2011/06/01: Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.
2011/06/01: Except for also being an artifact, <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing more (unless that creature is itself copying something or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2011/06/01: If <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies a noncreature artifact, it is no longer a creature.
2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2011/06/01: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is a Clone), then your <Phyrexian Metamorph> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied, except it's also an artifact.
2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent is a token, <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, except it's also an artifact. <Phyrexian Metamorph> is not a token.
2011/06/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when <Phyrexian Metamorph> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this] enters the battlefield" or "[this] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2011/06/01: If <Phyrexian Metamorph> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent (due to Mass Polymorph or Liliana Vess's third ability, for example), <Phyrexian Metamorph> can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a permanent that's already on the battlefield.
2011/06/01: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Phyrexian Metamorph> simply enters the battlefield as a 0/0 artifact creature and is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action (unless something else is raising its toughness).</Rulings>

<Watermark>Phyrexian</Watermark>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: Swampwalk is a keyword ability that means "This creature can't be blocked if defending player controls a Swamp." Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Graven Cairns is neither a Swamp nor a Mountain, while Blood Crypt is both.
2017/11/17: If another triggered ability during your upkeep causes you to sacrifice a creature, such as that of Lord of the Pit, you won't be able to target it with Sheoldred's triggered ability as that ability is put on the stack.
2017/11/17: The opponent whose upkeep it is chooses a creature to sacrifice when Sheoldred's second triggered ability resolves.
2017/11/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability will trigger twice at the beginning of the opposing team's upkeep, once for each player on that team. Each player sacrifices only a creature they control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: Normally, <Garruk's Horde> allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it at the time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
2011/09/22: You'll still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs.
2011/09/22: If the top card of your library is Dryad Arbor (the only card that's both a creature and a land), you can't play it this way. Dryad Arbor can't be cast as a spell.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>

<Flavor>For every eye, an eye. For every tooth, a tooth. Griffins are nothing if not fair.</Flavor>
<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: The source of combat damage is the creature that dealt it.
2009/05/01: If a spell causes damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Breath of Malfegor says "Breath of Malfegor deals 5 damage to each opponent."
2009/05/01: If an ability causes damage to be dealt, that ability will always identify the source of the damage. The ability itself is never the source. However, the source of the ability is often the source of the damage. For example, Deathbringer Thoctar's ability says "Deathbringer Thoctar deals 1 damage to any target."
2009/05/01: If the source of the damage is a permanent, <Retaliator Griffin> checks whether an opponent controls that permanent at the time that damage is dealt. If the permanent has left the battlefield by then, its last known information is used. If the source of the damage is a spell, whether it's controlled by an opponent is obvious. If the source of the damage is a card in some other zone (such as a cycled Jund Sojourners), <Retaliator Griffin> checks whether the card's owner, rather than its controller, is an opponent.
2009/05/01: If <Retaliator Griffin> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you're dealt damage by a source an opponent controls, <Retaliator Griffin> will be put into a graveyard before it would receive any counters. Its ability will still trigger, but it will do nothing when it resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kekai Kotaki</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: A land that becomes a creature may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2018/12/07: Once <Celestial Colonnade> has attacked, tapping it for mana won't remove it from combat.
2018/12/07: If <Celestial Colonnade> can't attack unless you pay a cost that includes a mana payment, you may attack with it and tap it to pay for that cost. It will still attack in this case.</Rulings>

<Artist>Yeong-Hao Han</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: You always perform your normal draw before this ability. The normal draw occurs before anything can be placed on the stack during a player's draw step.
2016/06/08: If you control other triggered abilities that allow you to draw cards during your draw step, you can choose to order <Sylvan Library>'s ability before or after those abilities. Triggered abilities controlled by other players will resolve before triggered abilities you control.
2016/06/08: Any cards drawn prior to <Sylvan Library>'s ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to <Sylvan Library>'s triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. <Sylvan Library>'s controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand.
2016/06/08: If you control more than one <Sylvan Library>, the triggered ability of each will resolve in sequence. You don't get to draw all the cards at once and then put them all back at once.
2016/06/08: You can put back zero, one, or two cards.
2016/06/08: If you choose to draw two cards, then replace one or more of those draws with some other effect, the rest of <Sylvan Library>'s ability still happens. If you've actually drawn only one card that turn, you must choose that card and either pay 4 life or put it on top of your library. If you haven't actually drawn any cards that turn, the rest of the ability has no effect.
2016/06/08: It's not possible to take any actions between drawing the cards and choosing two cards. You can't cast the cards you drew to avoid having two cards to choose.</Rulings>

<Artist>Greg Staples</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You lose control of the creature if the Old Man leaves the battlefield. This is because it is no longer tapped.
2009/10/01: If <Old Man of the Sea> stops being tapped before its ability resolves — even if it becomes tapped again right away — you won't gain control of the targeted creature at all. The same is true if the targeted creature's power becomes greater than <Old Man of the Sea>'s power before the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: The ability doesn't care whether <Old Man of the Sea> remains under your control, only that <Old Man of the Sea> remains tapped and its power remains large enough. If an opponent gains control of <Old Man of the Sea>, you'll keep control of the affected creature (until <Old Man of the Sea> stops being tapped or it no longer has enough power).
2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the targeted permanent remains a legal target for the ability, only that it's on the battlefield and its power remains small enough. The effect will continue to apply to it even if it gains shroud, stops being a creature, or would no longer be a legal target for any other reason. If it stops being a creature, its power is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).

Whenever you roll {CHAOS}, draw a card for each land you control.</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: A creature dealt damage by <Pillar of Flame> that dies this turn will be exiled even if it wasn't the target of <Pillar of Flame> (because the damage was redirected somehow). If the target creature isn't dealt damage (most likely because the damage was prevented), it won't be exiled if it dies that turn.
2017/11/17: A creature dealt damage by <Pillar of Flame> will be exiled no matter why the creature would die that turn. It could have its toughness reduced to 0 or less or be destroyed by another spell or ability.</Rulings>

<CardText>If an instant or sorcery card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Rulings>2012/10/01: If an instant or sorcery spell destroys <Dryad Militant> directly (like Murder does), that instant or sorcery card will be put into its owner's graveyard. However, if an instant or sorcery card deals lethal damage to <Dryad Militant>, <Dryad Militant> will remain on the battlefield until the next time state-based actions are checked, which is after the instant or sorcery finishes resolving. The instant or sorcery will be exiled.
2012/10/01: If an instant or sorcery card is discarded while <Dryad Militant> is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: The nonland permanents will be detained before blockers are chosen. Notably, a creature detained this way can't block before it is detained.

2013/04/15: When a player leaves a multiplayer game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player's next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.
2013/04/15: If a permanent's activated ability is on the stack when that permanent is detained, the ability will be unaffected.
2013/04/15: If a noncreature permanent is detained and later turns into a creature, it won't be able to attack or block.
2013/04/15: Activated abilities include a colon and are written in the form "[cost]: [effect]." No one can activate any activated abilities, including mana abilities, of a detained permanent.
2013/04/15: The static abilities of a detained permanent still apply. The triggered abilities of a detained permanent can still trigger.

<Rulings>2012/10/01: Remember, damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life (unless the source has infect).
2012/10/01: If no opponent has lost life on the turn <Cryptborn Horror> enters the battlefield, it will enter with no +1/+1 counters on it and be put into its owner's graveyard (unless something else is raising its toughness).
2012/10/01: <Cryptborn Horror> cares about the total life lost, not necessarily what an opponent's life total is compared to what it was at the beginning of the turn. For example, if an opponent loses 5 life and then gains 10 life on the turn <Cryptborn Horror> enters the battlefield, it will enter with five +1/+1 counters on it.
2012/10/01: In multiplayer games, life lost the turn <Cryptborn Horror> enters the battlefield by opponents who left the game later that turn will count toward the value of X.</Rulings>

If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.

If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Returning <Maze's End> to its owner's hand is part of the cost to activate its last ability. Once that ability is announced, players can't respond to it until after you've paid its activation cost and returned <Maze's End> to hand.
2013/04/15: When the last ability of <Maze's End> resolves, you'll search for a Gate and put it onto the battlefield before checking to see if you win the game. This check will happen even if you don't put a Gate onto the battlefield this way. This check will happen only as the ability resolves, not at other times.
2013/04/15: Putting a Gate onto the battlefield with <Maze's End> doesn't count as the one land you can play during your turn. If it's your turn, you can play <Maze's End> or a different land card from your hand after its ability has resolved.
2013/04/15: Controlling multiple Gates with the same name has no effect on your ability to win the game with <Maze's End>. The excess Gates are simply ignored.</Rulings>

<CardText>Play with the top card of your library revealed.
You may cast the top card of your library if it's an instant or sorcery card.
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your library, copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Johann Bodin</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Melek doesn't affect the timing rules associated with when you can cast the card. If it's a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2013/04/15: You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can't pay additional costs for the copy that's created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/04/15: Melek's last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets.
2013/04/15: When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2013/04/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Debt to the Deathless has), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/04/15: Instant and sorcery cards with miracle allow a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If you cast a spell this way, you're casting it from your hand, not your library. Melek's ability won't trigger.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.

<Artist>Erica Yang</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Colossal Whale>'s triggered ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step, before blocking creatures are declared.
2013/07/01: <Colossal Whale>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Colossal Whale> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2013/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2013/07/01: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2013/07/01: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of <Colossal Whale>.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if <Colossal Whale>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: As <Ratchet Bomb>'s last ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine how many charge counters were on it.
2011/01/01: <Ratchet Bomb>'s second ability destroys only those nonland permanents whose converted mana cost is exactly equal to the number of charge counters on <Ratchet Bomb>. It doesn't matter who controls them.
2011/01/01: If <Ratchet Bomb>'s second ability is activated while it has no charge counters on it, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2011/01/01: If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing.

2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: If you cast your second creature spell in a turn and <Vengevine> is in your graveyard, <Vengevine>'s second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of that spell. The ability will resolve, allowing you to return <Vengevine> to the battlefield before the creature spell resolves. The ability resolves even if that creature spell is countered.

2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability checks the spells you cast over the course of the entire turn, not just the ones you cast while <Vengevine> is in your graveyard.

2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s ability triggers only for the second creature spell you cast in a turn. It won't trigger for the third, fourth, or so on. It also doesn't matter how many noncreature spells you cast in a turn; the ability counts only the creature spells.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: <Nighthowler>'s last ability functions only from the battlefield. In other zones, <Nighthowler> is a 0/0 enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: Bestow is an alternative cost to cast the spell with bestow. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a bestow cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: A spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both. Similarly, a permanent with bestow is either a creature or an Aura, but not both.
2018/07/13: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow still resolves if its target is illegal. Instead of entering the battlefield as an Aura, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2018/07/13: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield or becomes an illegal creature for the Aura to enchant. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2018/07/13: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.

2011/09/22: If the spell that caused Riku's first ability to trigger has left the stack by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {U}{R}. If you do, you'll copy the spell as it last existed on the stack.
2011/09/22: Riku's first ability triggers whenever you cast any instant or sorcery spell, regardless of whether that spell has targets.
2011/09/22: If the copied spell has {X} in its mana cost, the value of X is copied.
2011/09/22: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy has the same mode as the original spell. You can't choose a different one.
2011/09/22: You can't pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Notably, if the original spell was kicked (or kicked a certain number of times), the copy will also be kicked (or kicked that many times).
2011/09/22: If the creature that caused Riku's second ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {G}{U}. If you do, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield. That token has the copiable values of the characteristics of that creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2011/09/22: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it.
2011/09/22: The copiable values of the token's characteristics are the same as the copiable values of the characteristics of the creature it's copying.
2011/09/22: If the creature had {X} in its mana cost, X must be 0. Note this is different from an {X} found in the mana cost of a copied spell.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"Oathbreaker, I cast you out!"</Flavor>
<Artist>James Zapata</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Banisher Priest>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Banisher Priest> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2013/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2013/07/01: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2013/07/01: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of <Banisher Priest>.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if <Banisher Priest>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell.

2013/10/17: Oloro's second ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life is gained.
2013/10/17: You decide whether to pay {1} as the second ability resolves. If you do, you'll draw a card and each opponent will lose 1 life.
2013/10/17: Oloro's first ability works only if Oloro is on the battlefield.
2013/10/17: In some unusual cases, you can gain life even though your life total actually decreases. For example, if you are being attacked by two 3/3 creatures and you block one with a 2/2 creature with lifelink, your life total will decrease by 1 even though you've gained 2 life. Oloro's second ability would trigger.
2013/10/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.
2013/10/17: If two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Oloro's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2015/01/19: <Oloro, Ageless Ascetic> is banned as a commander in Duel Commander format, but it may be part of your deck.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Dictate of the Twin Gods> applies to any damage, not just combat damage. It also doesn't matter who controls the source of the damage that's being dealt.
2014/04/26: The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, often the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will also specify the source of the damage, although the ability itself will never be that source. Often the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
2014/04/26: If more than one <Dictate of the Twin Gods> is on the battlefield, damage dealt will double for each one (two of them will end up multiplying the damage by four, three of them by eight, and four of them by sixteen).
2014/04/26: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, the ability of Decorated Griffin says "Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn." Suppose you would be dealt 3 combat damage and you activate the ability of Decorated Griffin. You can either (a) prevent 1 damage first and then let <Dictate of the Twin Gods>'s effect double the remaining 2 damage, for a result of being dealt 4 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent 1 damage, for a result of being dealt 5 damage.</Rulings>

<CardText>Artifact spells you cast have convoke. (Your creatures can help cast those spells. Each creature you tap while casting an artifact spell pays for {1} or one mana of that creature's color.)</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Barger</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: Multiple instances of convoke on a single spell are redundant.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Artist>Karla Ortiz</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: <Mercurial Pretender>'s ability doesn't target the chosen creature.
2014/07/18: The activated ability <Mercurial Pretender> gives itself becomes part of its copiable values. Unless the ability is overwritten by another copy effect, a creature that's a copy of <Mercurial Pretender> will have that ability.
2014/07/18: <Mercurial Pretender> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, etc. For example, if <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as a copy of a Profane Memento with Ensoul Artifact attached to it, <Mercurial Pretender> will be a noncreature Profane Memento with <Mercurial Pretender>'s added activated ability.
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Genesis Hydra), X is 0.
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Mercurial Pretender>), then <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying (plus any abilities it gained as part of the copying process, if applicable).
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature is a token, <Mercurial Pretender> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Mercurial Pretender> is not a token, even when copying one.
2014/07/18: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2014/07/18: If <Mercurial Pretender> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Mercurial Pretender> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2014/07/18: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

2014/02/01: If the target creature is an illegal target as <Bile Blight> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No creature will get -3/-3.
2014/02/01: The name of a creature token is the same as its creature types, unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 Cat Soldier creature token is named "Cat Soldier."</Rulings>

<CardText>When Banishing Light enters the battlefield, exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Banishing Light leaves the battlefield. (That permanent returns under its owner's control.)</CardText>
<Artist>Wesley Burt</Artist>
<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Banishing Light>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Banishing Light> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the permanent when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield.
2014/04/26: If <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target nonland permanent won't be exiled.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2014/04/26: If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2014/04/26: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. <Banishing Light> and the returned card aren't on the battlefield at the same time.
2014/04/26: In a multiplayer game, if <Banishing Light>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2013/09/15: The last ability applies to creature cards in any zone, provided something is allowing you to cast them.

<Artist>Mathias Kollros</Artist>
<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

Notably, you can't turn <Rattleclaw Mystic> face up while casting a spell or activating an ability. You'll need to turn <Rattleclaw Mystic> face up and have its triggered ability resolve before you can spend that mana.
2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: If the opponent pays tribute, the creature will enter the battlefield with the specified number of +1/+1 counters on it. It won't enter the battlefield and then have the +1/+1 counters placed on it.
2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
2014/02/01: If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.
2014/02/01: Players can't respond to the tribute decision before the creature enters the battlefield. That is, if the opponent doesn't pay tribute, the triggered ability will trigger before any player has a chance to remove the creature.
2014/02/01: The triggered ability will resolve even if the creature with tribute isn't on the battlefield at that time.
2017/04/18: For effects that check which player put counters on the entering creature, the player chosen to pay tribute puts those counters on it, not the creature's controller.</Rulings>

{3}{W}: Manifest the top card of your library. (Put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)</CardText>
<Artist>Daniel Ljunggren</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: You choose which opponent or opposing planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker <Flamerush Rider> is attacking.
2014/11/24: Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2014/11/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it doesn't copy any effects that may have turned a noncreature permanent into a creature. If the token isn't a creature as it enters the battlefield, it won't be attacking.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Flamerush Rider> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2014/11/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2014/11/24: If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, you won't exile that creature at end of combat. However, if <Flamerush Rider> creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you'll exile each of those tokens.
2014/11/24: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2014/11/24: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2014/11/24: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
2014/11/24: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2014/11/24: If you return a face-down creature to its owner's hand, the token will be a face-up colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no abilities, and no creature types. (The face-down creature card will be revealed to all players as it leaves the battlefield.)
2014/11/24: If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Supplant Form> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature was copying something else or was a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.</Rulings>

<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Watermark>Sultai</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: The rules for delve have changed slightly since it was last in an expansion. Previously, delve reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under the current rules, you exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/09/20: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, Dead Drop's converted mana cost is 10 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2014/09/20: You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
2014/09/20: You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than nine cards from your graveyard to cast Dead Drop.
2014/09/20: Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.</Rulings>

<Artist>Marco Nelor</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/09/15: At the beginning of the next end step, the creature returned to the battlefield with <Whip of Erebos> is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2013/09/15: <Whip of Erebos> grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2013/09/15: If a creature returned to the battlefield with <Whip of Erebos> would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead. However, if that creature is already being exiled, then the replacement effect won't apply. If the spell or ability that exiles it later returns it to the battlefield (as Chained to the Rocks might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The effects from <Whip of Erebos> will no longer apply to it.
2013/09/15: The exiled creature is never put into the graveyard. Any abilities the creature has that trigger when it dies won't trigger.</Rulings>

2013/09/15: If <Reaper of the Wilds> dies at the same time as another creature, its ability will trigger for that other creature.
2013/09/15: When you scry, you may put all the cards you look at back on top of your library, you may put all of those cards on the bottom of your library, or you may put some of those cards on top and the rest of them on the bottom.
2013/09/15: You choose how to order cards returned to your library after scrying no matter where you put them.
2013/09/15: You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and abilities, that means you'll scry last. For others, that means you'll scry and then perform other actions.
2013/09/15: Scry appears on some spells and abilities with one or more targets. If all of the spell or ability's targets are illegal when it tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't scry.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.

2014/11/24: A card's owner is public information at all times.

2018/07/13: If an effect tries to return a face-down creature to the battlefield after it leaves (such as Aminatou's second ability or Adarkar Valkyrie's delayed triggered ability), that effect returns the card face up. If it tries to put an instant or sorcery card onto the battlefield this way, that card remains in its current zone instead.

<Rulings>2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.

It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Dualcaster Mage>'s triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2016/06/08: As <Dualcaster Mage>'s triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/06/08: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: A nonland permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker card.
2017/11/17: If you put an Aura onto the battlefield this way, you choose what it enchants as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target any permanent or player, but it must be able to enchant that permanent or player. For example, you could put a green Aura onto the battlefield enchanting a creature with hexproof controlled by an opponent, but not one with protection from green.
2017/11/17: If "the rest" is zero cards, either because X was 0 or because X was 1 and that card was put onto the battlefield, the library is still shuffled.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"She will come back to me."</Flavor>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/07: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature card (except that the copy is also an artifact) and nothing else.
2014/11/07: If the copied creature card has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/07: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature card will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature card will also work.
2014/11/07: If another creature becomes a copy of, or enters the battlefield as a copy of, the token, that creature will copy the creature card the token is copying, except it will also be an artifact. This is true even if the creature card that was copied by <Feldon of the Third Path> is no longer in the graveyard at that time. However, the new copy won't gain haste and you won't sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.
2014/11/07: If Feldon's ability creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (such as the one Doubling Season creates), each of those tokens will gain haste and you'll sacrifice each of them.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Suspension Field enters the battlefield, you may exile target creature with toughness 3 or greater until Suspension Field leaves the battlefield. (That creature returns under its owner's control.)</CardText>
<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: <Suspension Field>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration. It's a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Suspension Field> leaves the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If the target creature becomes an illegal target before the ability resolves, perhaps because its toughness was lowered, the ability won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No creature will be exiled, and <Suspension Field> will remain on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If <Suspension Field> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2014/09/20: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2014/09/20: If a token is exiled this way, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2014/09/20: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Suspension Field> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between these two events, including state-based actions. <Suspension Field> and the returned card aren't on the battlefield at the same time.
2014/09/20: In a multiplayer game, if <Suspension Field>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Craig J Spearing</Artist>
<Watermark>Ojutai</Watermark>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/02/25: You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren't chosen. For example, you can cast <Ojutai's Command> without targeting a creature spell provided you don't choose the third mode.
2015/02/25: As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of <Ojutai's Command>, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won't matter in most cases.)
2015/02/25: If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets for the copy, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/02/25: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: You can't reveal more than one Dragon card to multiply the bonus. There is also no additional benefit for both revealing a Dragon card as an additional cost and controlling a Dragon as you cast the spell.
2015/02/25: If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus. For example, if you lose control of your only Dragon while casting the spell (because, for example, you sacrificed it to activate a mana ability), you won't get the bonus.</Rulings>

<Artist>Richard Wright</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: Alhammarret's second ability happens as Alhammarret enters the battlefield. No one can cast spells or activate abilities between the time a card is named and the time that Alhammarret's last ability starts to work.
2015/06/22: You choose one card name, not one name per opponent.
2015/06/22: Although spells with the chosen name can't be cast, permanent cards with that name can still be put onto the battlefield by a spell or ability.
2015/06/22: If your opponents have no nonland cards in their hands, you can't choose a card name. Alhammarret's last ability won't stop any spells from being cast in that case.
2015/06/22: Your opponents can still cast a card with the chosen name face down if it has a morph ability. A card with the chosen name can also be manifested.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deckbuilding and game play.
2015/08/25: A card with devoid is just colorless. It's not colorless and the colors of mana in its mana cost.

2015/08/25: If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.

<CardText>When you cast this spell, you may put two cards your opponents own from exile into their owners' graveyards. If you do, create three 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature tokens. They have "Sacrifice this creature: Add {C}."</CardText>
<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by Anafenza, the Foremost), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
2015/08/25: Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile their hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use Wasteland Strangler to put one of those cards into their graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.

<Artist>Winona Nelson</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

Awaken 4—{5}{B}{B} (If you cast this spell for {5}{B}{B}, also put four +1/+1 counters on target land you control and it becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste. It's still a land.)</CardText>
<Artist>Aaron Miller</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: You can cast a spell with awaken for its mana cost and get only its first effect. If you cast a spell for its awaken cost, you'll get both effects.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell won't resolve if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.
2015/08/25: Awaken doesn't give the land you control a color. As most lands are colorless, in most cases the resulting land creature will also be colorless.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: If <Stasis Snare> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2015/08/25: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2015/08/25: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/08/25: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Stasis Snare> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/08/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Stasis Snare>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Barger</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast <Radiant Flames> and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

Madness {2}{R} (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever Identity Thief attacks, you may exile another target nontoken creature. If you do, Identity Thief becomes a copy of that creature until end of turn. Return the exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: If the targeted creature has an ability that triggers when it attacks, it'll be too late for it to trigger once <Identity Thief> has that ability. The same is true if another object has an ability that triggers when a creature with certain characteristics attacks and <Identity Thief> doesn't have those characteristics until after it becomes a copy.
2016/07/13: <Identity Thief> copies the printed values of the targeted creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to that creature. It won't copy other effects that have changed the targeted creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. It also won't copy counters on the targeted creature.
2016/07/13: If the targeted creature is a double-faced or melded permanent, <Identity Thief> copies the face shown. Because <Identity Thief> is not a double-faced card or meld card, it won't be able to transform or meld. If it copies a melded permanent or the back face of a double-faced card, its converted mana cost will be 0. Exiled double-faced cards and exiled meld cards will return with their front faces up.
2016/07/13: If the targeted creature is itself copying a permanent, <Identity Thief> will become whatever it's copying, as modified by that copy effect. For example, if you target a Hamlet Captain that has become a copy of Permeating Mass, <Identity Thief> will become a Permeating Mass.
2016/07/13: This effect can cause <Identity Thief> to stop being a creature. For example, if you target an animated Gideon Jura (a planeswalker with a loyalty ability that turns him into a creature), only the printed wording will be copied; the "becomes a creature" effect won't. <Identity Thief> will become a noncreature Gideon with no loyalty, be removed from combat, and then be put into its owner's graveyard.
2016/07/13: This effect can cause <Identity Thief> to become a copy of a creature that can't normally attack, such as Lupine Prototype or a creature with defender. In these cases, it remains attacking.
2016/07/13: Noncopy effects that have already applied to <Identity Thief> will continue to apply to it. For example, if Woodcutter's Grit gave <Identity Thief> +3/+3 and hexproof earlier in the turn, <Identity Thief> will still have those bonuses after copying a creature.
2016/07/13: <Identity Thief> will still be a copy of the creature during the next end step when the exiled card returns. If it has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger for <Identity Thief> and not for the returned creature.
2016/07/13: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</Rulings>

• Create a token that's a copy of target creature, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types.</CardText>
<Flavor>"From the first touch, I know exactly what the metal wants to be."</Flavor>
<Artist>Wesley Burt</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/09/20: If you chose the second mode, the token is an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value of the token that other effects may copy.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent is copying something else (for example, if the copied permanent is an Altered Ego), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent copied.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent is a token, the token created with <Saheeli's Artistry> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that that created that token.
2016/09/20: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2016/09/20: If you choose both modes, you may target a single artifact creature twice and get two copies of that artifact creature.
2016/09/20: If you choose both modes, the tokens enter one at a time. Thus, if the token created by the second mode has an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact enters the battlefield," the token created by the first mode will already be on the battlefield and won't cause that ability to trigger.
2016/09/20: Any abilities that trigger during the resolution of <Saheeli's Artistry> will wait to be put onto the stack until <Saheeli's Artistry> finishes resolving. An ability that triggers on the first token entering the battlefield may target the second token and vice versa.</Rulings>

Madness {R} (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)</CardText>
<Flavor>"Let the flames ignore the sinless."</Flavor>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

2016/09/20: You choose whether or not to have your other attacking creatures get +X/+X as <Cultivator of Blades>'s triggered ability resolves, not as you put it onto the stack.
2016/09/20: You choose whether to put +1/+1 counters on the creature or create Servo tokens as the fabricate ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose and the time that counters are added or tokens are created.
2016/09/20: Fabricate doesn't cause the creature with the ability to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters already on it. For example, Weaponcraft Enthusiast will enter the battlefield as a 0/1 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.
2016/09/20: If you can't put +1/+1 counters on the creature for any reason as fabricate resolves (for instance, if it's no longer on the battlefield), you just create Servo tokens.
2017/07/14: If this creature's power is negative as its ability resolves, X is considered to be 0. (This is a change from previous rulings.)</Rulings>

<Artist>Lars Grant-West</Artist>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If you cast a 2/2 Grizzly Bears, for example, you may then search for any creature with total power and toughness 4. It can be 0/4, 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1.
2007/02/01: The game checks the power and toughness of the creature that just entered the battlefield as it exists on the battlefield. That might mean it's impossible to get another copy of that same card. For example, a Triskelion on the battlefield is 4/4, but a Triskelion in your library is 1/1. The power and toughness might also have been affected while the triggered ability was on the stack (such as with Giant Growth, Sudden Death, or Ovinize).
2007/02/01: If the creature that entered the battlefield has left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, use the power and toughness of that creature as it last appeared before leaving the battlefield.</Rulings>

Notably, this means that if you activate <Scavenging Ooze>'s ability multiple times targeting the same creature card, only the first instance of the ability to resolve will have any effect.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag says "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you control Vivid Crag and <Reflecting Pool>, you can tap <Reflecting Pool> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do. It just cares about types of mana.
2008/05/01: Multiple <Reflecting Pool>s won't help each other produce mana. If you control a <Reflecting Pool>, and all other lands you control either lack mana abilities or are other <Reflecting Pool>s, you may still activate <Reflecting Pool>'s ability — it just won't produce any mana.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/01/22: Kozilek's triggered ability checks to see if you have fewer than seven cards in hand when you cast it. Kozilek is on the stack at this time and not in your hand. If you don't, the ability won't trigger at all. If the ability does trigger, it will check again as it tries to resolve. If you have seven or more cards in hand at that time, the ability won't do anything.
2016/01/22: To activate the last ability, there must be a legal target: a spell on the stack. That target will determine the value of X and the converted mana cost of the card you discard. You can't activate the ability unless you can match the converted mana cost of a spell on the stack to that of a card in your hand.
2016/01/22: The converted mana cost of a spell doesn't change, even if it's been cast using an alternative cost (such as an awaken cost). For example, the converted mana cost of a Sheer Drop (a spell with mana cost {2}{W}) that's been cast for its awaken cost of {5}{W} is 3.
2016/01/22: If there's an {X} in the mana cost of the card you discard, that X is 0. Any {X} in the mana cost of the target spell will have whatever value was determined for it as the spell was cast.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: Face-down creatures have a converted mana cost of 0. If one is exiled by <Silkwrap>, it will return to the battlefield face up.
2015/02/25: <Silkwrap>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Silkwrap> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Silkwrap> leaves the battlefield.
2015/02/25: If <Silkwrap> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2015/02/25: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2015/02/25: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/02/25: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Silkwrap> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/02/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Silkwrap>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: Playing the card exiled with <Abbot of Keral Keep>'s ability follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card by paying its mana cost only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2015/06/22: Unless an effect allows you to play additional lands that turn, you can play a land card exiled with <Abbot of Keral Keep>'s ability only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2015/06/22: If you don't play the card, it will remain exiled.
2015/06/22: Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
2015/06/22: Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
2015/06/22: Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.</Rulings>

<CardText>All creatures get -3/-3 until end of turn.
You may cast a card with converted mana cost 3 or less from your hand without paying its mana cost.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/02/09: If a creature's toughness is reduced to 0 or less by <Yahenni's Expertise>, that creature is still on the battlefield as you cast your free spell. It can be the target of that spell, although it will become an illegal target before that spell resolves. If it has any abilities that trigger on the spell being cast, those abilities will trigger.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If an expertise spell allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half or, if that split card has fuse, both halves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before they declare blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
2018/12/07: Emrakul's second ability triggers as you cast it, and that ability resolves before the spell itself. It resolves even if that spell is somehow removed from the stack.
2018/12/07: Emrakul can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Countersquall). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2018/12/07: "Colored spells" is not synonymous with "colored cards." For example, even though creatures are spells when they're cast, they're not spells when they're on the battlefield and can block Emrakul; and triggered abilities of permanents entering the battlefield (such as that of Banishing Light) can target it.
2018/12/07: Emrakul can't be the target of colored Aura spells, but colored Auras can be put onto the battlefield enchanting it.</Rulings>

You can activate the creature card's embalm ability before any player can exile it with an effect, such as that of Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an embalm ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnatnion.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.
2017/04/18: If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: If a creature has a targeted triggered ability that triggers when you exert it, you can exert it even if there isn't a legal target for that triggered ability.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set. You can't do so later in combat, and creatures put onto the battlefield attacking can't be exerted. Any abilities that trigger on exerting an attacking creature will resolve before blockers are declared.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.

These supplements are not required to play with cards with eternalize; you can use the same items to represent an eternalized token as you would any other token.
2017/07/14: If a creature card with eternalize is put into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately afterward. You can activate its eternalize ability before any player can try to exile it, such as with Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an eternalize ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.

<Artist>Jason Kang</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/07/13: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/07/13: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2018/07/13: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2018/07/13: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2018/07/13: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Saheeli's Directive and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{R}{R}{R}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{R}{R}{R}.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"This fight belongs to us all."</Flavor>
<Artist>David Palumbo</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2017/02/09: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3.
2017/02/09: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.
2017/02/09: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2017/02/09: You can target any permanent card in your graveyard with converted mana cost 2 or less, not just one that was put there from the battlefield this turn.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

<CardText>+2: During target opponent's next turn, creatures that player controls attack Gideon Jura if able.
-2: Destroy target tapped creature.
0: Until end of turn, Gideon Jura becomes a 6/6 Human Soldier creature that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability causes creatures to attack him if able. If, during the affected player's declare attackers step, a creature they control is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2010/06/15: If a creature controlled by the affected player can't attack <Gideon Jura> (because he's no longer on the battlefield, for example), that player may have it attack you, another one of your planeswalkers, or nothing at all.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability applies during each combat phase of the affected player's next turn (as opposed to applying during the affected player's next combat phase). The distinction is relevant if there are no combat phases during that turn (due to Fatespinner's effect, for example) or there are multiples (due to World at War, for example).
2010/06/15: If <Gideon Jura> becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. <Gideon Jura> was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. That's because the effect states a true thing about a set of creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, whatever creatures the targeted opponent controls during the declare attackers step of their next turn must attack <Gideon Jura> if able. This includes creatures that come under that player's control after the ability has resolved and creatures that have lost all abilities.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2010/06/15: If you activate <Gideon Jura>'s third ability and then unpreventable damage is dealt to him (due to Unstable Footing, for example), that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on <Gideon Jura> (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If the total amount of damage marked on <Gideon Jura> is lethal damage, he's destroyed as a state-based action. If <Gideon Jura> has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2010/06/15: Say you activate <Gideon Jura>'s third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack <Gideon Jura> (since he's still a planeswalker). Then <Gideon Jura> may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him! During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.
2010/06/15: If <Gideon Jura> becomes a creature, he may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any) unless he began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when <Gideon Jura> came under your control, not when he became a creature.
2011/01/22: The first ability only affects the declaration of attackers. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking (thanks to Hero of Bladehold, Preeminent Captain, or the Ninjutsu ability, for example), that creature's controller may choose the defending player or planeswalker that it will be attacking in the normal way.</Rulings>

-7: Exile the top ten cards of your library. Choose an instant or sorcery card exiled this way and copy it three times. You may cast the copies without paying their mana costs.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: To activate the first ability, you must target a player but you can choose to not target any creatures.
2014/07/18: If the first ability resolves but the damage is prevented or redirected, the target creature still won't be able to block that turn.
2014/07/18: The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Playing it follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2014/07/18: If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/07/18: In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
2014/07/18: While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
2014/07/18: While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
2014/07/18: Because you're casting the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/07/18: If the copied card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copies.</Rulings>

2012/07/01: For the third ability, if the player is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt, no cards will be discarded, and no permanents will be sacrificed.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Additional mana spent to cover the differences in mana costs is not part of the mana cost of this spell. It is spent during spell resolution.

2004/10/04: If the chosen artifact costs less than or the same as the sacrificed artifact, you simply put it onto the battlefield without paying any additional costs.
2004/10/04: Because the "search" requires you to find a card with certain characteristics, you don't have to find the card if you don't want to.
2011/01/01: The sacrifice of an artifact is an effect of the spell, not a cost, which means it happens as the spell resolves. If <Transmute Artifact> is countered, you do not have to sacrifice an artifact.</Rulings>

<CardText>If a player would draw a card except the first one they draw in their draw step each turn, that player discards a card instead. If the player discards a card this way, they draw a card. If the player doesn't discard a card this way, they put the top card of their library into their graveyard.</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The effect is cumulative. If there are two of these on the battlefield, each of them will modify each draw (after the first one if during the draw step), and will cause the player to discard or to "mill" a card from their library. As they resolve in order, the player must discard if possible. Once the player fails to discard and instead "mills" a card, all further effects of additional <Chains of Mephistopheles> will not do anything. This is because the "mill" also replaces the draw effect and the player is no longer drawing a card. You handle them in order. Each one makes you discard first and then continue or else mill a card and lose the draw.
2004/10/04: Cards which are drawn as a cost are affected by this card because replacement effects can alter the payment of costs.
2007/09/16: If a spell or ability would cause a player to draw multiple cards, this is treated as a number of individual "draw one card" actions. Apply the effect of <Chains of Mephistopheles> to each one.
2007/09/16: A player's normal card draw on their turn is exempt from this effect. All other draws will be affected.
2007/09/16: Here's what happens when <Chains of Mephistopheles> replaces a player's draw: — If that player has at least one card in their hand, they discard a card and then draws a card. — If that player's hand is empty, they put the top card of their library into their graveyard. The player doesn't draw a card at all.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: To determine Ghalta's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. Ghalta's converted mana cost remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/01/19: The total cost to cast Ghalta is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if you control three 2/2 creatures, including one you can sacrifice to add {C}, the total cost of Ghalta is {4}{G}{G}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2018/01/19: If a creature's power is somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of your other creatures. If the total power of your creatures is 0 or less, Ghalta's cost remains {10}{G}{G}.

<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: Spells your opponents control can target Shanna.
2018/04/27: Shanna's ability that modifies its power and toughness applies only while it's on the battlefield. In all other zones, it's a 0/0 creature card.
2018/04/27: As long as it's on the battlefield, Shanna's last ability will count itself, so it'll be at least 1/1.
2018/04/27: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Shanna may become lethal if other creatures you control leave the battlefield during that turn.</Rulings>

Traxos, Scourge of Kroog enters the battlefield tapped and doesn't untap during your untap step.

<Artist>Titus Lunter</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: A card, spell, or permanent is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make an object more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—an object either is historic or it isn't.
2018/04/27: Some abilities trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell." Such an ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/04/27: An ability that triggers "whenever you cast a historic spell" doesn't trigger if a historic card is put onto the battlefield without being cast.
2018/04/27: Lands are never cast, so abilities that trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell" won't trigger if you play a legendary land. They also won't trigger if a card on the battlefield transforms into a legendary land, as the Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan double-faced cards do.</Rulings>

<Artist>Lucas Graciano</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

2017/09/29: <Hostage Taker> has received errata to prevent it from targeting itself. The correct Oracle wording appears above.
2017/09/29: If <Hostage Taker> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2017/09/29: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2017/09/29: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield. You can't cast it.
2017/09/29: Once you begin to cast the exiled card, it's considered a new object. You'll control that spell and the permanent that spell becomes even if <Hostage Taker> leaves the battlefield.
2017/09/29: If it's still in exile, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Hostage Taker> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2017/09/29: In a multiplayer game, if <Hostage Taker>'s owner leaves the game while the card is still exiled and another player owns that card, the exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2017/09/29: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spell or permanent cards you control from <Hostage Taker>'s ability are exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: The value of each X in <Walking Ballista>'s mana cost must be equal. For example, if X is 2, you'll pay {4} to cast <Walking Ballista> and it will enter the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it.
2017/02/09: If <Walking Ballista> has been dealt damage or had its toughness reduced by an effect, this limits how many times you'll be able to remove +1/+1 counters from it in a single turn. For example, if it has three +1/+1 counters on it and has been dealt 1 damage this turn, it will be destroyed immediately after you activate the ability a second time and you won't be able to activate it a third time.</Rulings>

<CardText>Chalice of the Void enters the battlefield with X charge counters on it.
Whenever a player casts a spell with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Chalice of the Void, counter that spell.</CardText>
<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: A mana cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {6} to cast <Chalice of the Void>.
2018/03/16: The number of counters on <Chalice of the Void> matters only at the time the spell is cast. Changing the number of charge counters on <Chalice of the Void> after a spell has been cast won't change whether the ability counters the spell.
2018/03/16: If there are zero charge counters on <Chalice of the Void>, it counters each spell with a converted mana cost of 0. This includes face-down creature spells cast with morph's alternative cost.
2018/03/16: <Chalice of the Void> has to be on the battlefield at the end of casting a spell for the ability to trigger. If you sacrifice <Chalice of the Void> as a cost to cast a spell, its ability can't trigger. However, if it leaves the battlefield once its ability has triggered, that ability will still counter the spell.</Rulings>

<CardText>+1: Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player this turn, draw a card, then discard a card.
-2: Create a 2/2 blue Illusion creature token with "When this creature becomes the target of a spell, sacrifice it."
-5: Create two tokens that are copies of Jace, Cunning Castaway, except they're not legendary.</CardText>
<Artist>Terese Nielsen</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/09/29: The delayed triggered ability created by Jace's first ability can trigger more than once in a turn if creatures you control deal combat damage at different times in a turn (most likely because one or more has first strike) or if creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at once.
2017/09/29: If a token created by Jace's second ability becomes the target of a spell, its ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of that spell. The ability will resolve first (causing the token to be sacrificed). Unless the spell has another target, it will then be countered when it tries to resolve for having no legal targets.
2017/09/29: The tokens from Jace's last ability copy exactly what is printed on Jace and nothing else. They don't copy how many counters are on him or Auras attached to him, or any non-copy effects that have changed his color or types, and so on. They'll each enter the battlefield with three loyalty counters. You can activate one loyalty ability of each of the tokens this turn.
2017/09/29: The tokens created by Jace's last ability don't have the legendary supertype. If another object becomes a copy of the token, that copy also won't be legendary.

<Artist>Terese Nielsen</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands. If the card exiled with Chandra's first ability is a land card, you can't play it and Chandra deals 2 damage to each opponent.
2016/09/20: If you cast the exiled card, you do so as part of the resolution of Chandra's ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.
2016/09/20: You pay the costs for the exiled card if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as emerge rather than the card's mana cost.
2016/09/20: Loyalty abilities can't be mana abilities. Chandra's second ability uses the stack and can be countered or otherwise responded to. Like all loyalty abilities, it can be activated only once per turn, during your main phase, when the stack is empty, and only if no other loyalty abilities of the planeswalker have been activated this turn.
2016/09/20: The emblem created by Chandra's last ability is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.
2016/09/20: Chandra's emblem's ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger.
2016/09/20: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Chandra's first ability causes 4 damage total to be dealt to the opposing team.</Rulings>

<Artist>Terese Nielsen</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: Gideon's first ability will continue to prevent damage dealt by the target permanent even if Gideon leaves the battlefield before your next turn.
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
2017/04/18: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2017/04/18: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
2017/04/18: If Gideon leaves the battlefield after giving you his emblem, you'll keep the emblem. Its effect will apply again later if another Gideon comes under your control.
2017/04/18: No game effect can cause you to lose the game or cause any opponent to win the game while Gideon's emblem is in effect. It doesn't matter whether you have 0 or less life, you're forced to draw a card while your library is empty, you have ten or more poison counters, you're at your Glorious End, your opponent casts a second Approach of the Second Sun, or so on. You keep playing.
2017/04/18: Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your Magic Online® game clock runs out of time.
2017/04/18: If you have Gideon's emblem in a Two-Headed Giant game and control a Gideon planeswalker, your team can't lose the game and the opposing team can't win the game. If your teammate controls a Gideon planeswalker but you do not, your emblem's effect doesn't apply.</Rulings>
