<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

<CardText>If a player would draw a card except the first one they draw in their draw step each turn, that player discards a card instead. If the player discards a card this way, they draw a card. If the player doesn't discard a card this way, they put the top card of their library into their graveyard.</CardText>
<Artist>Heather Hudson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>159823</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The effect is cumulative. If there are two of these on the battlefield, each of them will modify each draw (after the first one if during the draw step), and will cause the player to discard or to "mill" a card from their library. As they resolve in order, the player must discard if possible. Once the player fails to discard and instead "mills" a card, all further effects of additional <Chains of Mephistopheles> will not do anything. This is because the "mill" also replaces the draw effect and the player is no longer drawing a card. You handle them in order. Each one makes you discard first and then continue or else mill a card and lose the draw.
2004/10/04: Cards which are drawn as a cost are affected by this card because replacement effects can alter the payment of costs.
2007/09/16: If a spell or ability would cause a player to draw multiple cards, this is treated as a number of individual "draw one card" actions. Apply the effect of <Chains of Mephistopheles> to each one.
2007/09/16: A player's normal card draw on their turn is exempt from this effect. All other draws will be affected.
2007/09/16: Here's what happens when <Chains of Mephistopheles> replaces a player's draw: — If that player has at least one card in their hand, they discard a card and then draws a card. — If that player's hand is empty, they put the top card of their library into their graveyard. The player doesn't draw a card at all.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: A card is "above" another card in your graveyard if it was put into that graveyard later.
2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/09/16: The losses, discards, and sacrifices are rounded up. For example, if you have 5 life, you'll lose 2 life, leaving you at 3 life. (Five divided by three is one and two-thirds. Rounding that up to the nearest whole number gives you two.)
2007/09/16: Each part of <Pox>'s effect is processed separately. For each part, first the player whose turn it is makes all necessary choices (such as which cards to discard), then each other player in turn order chooses, then the actions happen at the same time. Then <Pox>'s effect moves to the next stage.
2007/09/16: The number you need to lose, discard, or sacrifice isn't calculated until it's time to perform that part of the effect. For example, if your opponent casts <Pox> and you discard Dodecapod as part of <Pox>'s discard effect, Dodecapod will be put onto the battlefield instead of into your graveyard. Then, when determining how many creatures you need to sacrifice, the Dodecapod is taken into account.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then a player puts <Cursed Rack> onto the battlefield choosing you, your maximum hand size will be four. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>
