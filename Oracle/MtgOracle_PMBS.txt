<CardText>Battle cry (Whenever this creature attacks, each other attacking creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn.)
Whenever Hero of Bladehold attacks, create two 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens that are tapped and attacking.</CardText>

<Watermark>Mirran</Watermark>
<Rulings>2011/06/01: Whenever <Hero of Bladehold> attacks, both abilities will trigger. You can put them onto the stack in any order. If the token-creating ability resolves first, the tokens each get +1/+0 until end of turn from the battle cry ability.
2011/06/01: You choose which opponent or planeswalker an opponent controls that each token is attacking when it is put onto the battlefield.
2011/06/01: Although the tokens are attacking, they never were declared as attacking creatures (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).</Rulings>
