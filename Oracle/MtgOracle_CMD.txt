2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: During your turn, <Angelic Arbiter>'s abilities have no effect on the game.
2010/08/15: During an opponent's turn, that opponent may either cast spells or attack with creatures, but not both (assuming that <Angelic Arbiter> is on the battlefield for the entirety of that turn). The player may perform other actions, such as activating abilities and playing lands.
2010/08/15: If <Angelic Arbiter> leaves the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities cease to affect the game. For example, if an opponent casts Doom Blade to destroy <Angelic Arbiter>, that player may then attack with creatures.
2010/08/15: If <Angelic Arbiter> enters the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities take actions that player performed earlier in the turn into account, even though it wasn't on the battlefield at the time. For example, if an opponent casts a spell, then you use Leyline of Anticipation's ability to cast <Angelic Arbiter> as though it had flash, that player won't be able to attack with creatures that turn.
2010/08/15: <Angelic Arbiter>'s last ability applies if an opponent attacked with at least one creature during the current turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: Abilities that trigger when a player gains life may trigger as a result of this ability.
2007/10/01: In other multiplayer formats, each player's life total is set to the highest life total within their range of influence. These changes happen at the same time. For example, if each player has a range of influence of one, and the players in the game are Alice (4 life), Barry (8 life), Carrie (11 life), and Doug (7 life), in that order, then Alice's life total will become 8 and Barry and Doug's life totals will each become 11.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team chooses one person on that team to gain the appropriate amount of life. This basically means that the triggered ability will set the life total of each team to that of the team with the highest life total.</Rulings>

2011/09/22: The active player chooses war or peace first, followed by each other player in turn order. Each player will know what previous players chose when making their choice.
2011/09/22: <Archangel of Strife>'s bonuses apply immediately. Depending on your choice, <Archangel of Strife> will enter the battlefield as either a 9/6 or 6/9 creature.

2017/11/17: If the first and third modes are chosen, an artifact creature with converted mana cost 3 or less will have to be regenerated twice to survive. This is because the modes happen sequentially, and the regeneration "shield" is used up by the first one. (A similar thing happens with most of the other combinations.)

<Multiverseid>247383</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<CardText>If a white creature is attacking, you may pay {B}{B} rather than pay this spell's mana cost.
Exile target attacking creature. Create a token that's a copy of that creature. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>247541</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: If you cast <Nemesis Trap> for {B}{B}, you may still target any attacking creature, not just the white attacking creature.
2010/03/01: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2010/03/01: If you cast <Nemesis Trap> during your opponent's declare attackers step, you'll put the token onto the battlefield before the declare blockers step begins and you can block with it this combat. If you cast <Nemesis Trap> later in the combat phase a, you won't be able to block with the token.
2010/03/01: The token you put onto the battlefield copies exactly what was printed on the exiled creature and nothing more (unless it was copying something else or it was a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether the exiled creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. For example, if <Nemesis Trap> targets an animated Celestial Colonnade, the token you put onto the battlefield will be a Celestial Colonnade that's just a land. (Because of this, <Nemesis Trap> has received minor errata to specify that you put a token, not a "creature token," onto the battlefield.)
2010/03/01: If the exiled creature was copying something else (for example, if it was a Jwari Shapeshifter), then your token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever the exiled creature was copying.
2010/03/01: If the exiled creature was a token, your token copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2010/03/01: If the exiled creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2010/03/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the exiled creature will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2010/03/01: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Nemesis Trap> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. You won't get a token.</Rulings>

No player can respond between the time you declare how many times you'll kick the spell and the time you choose the targets.
2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want <Comet Storm> to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.
2010/03/01: As long as any of its targets are legal at the time <Comet Storm> resolves, <Comet Storm> will deal X damage to each of those legal targets.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>247336</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

2011/09/22: Since opponents can't search libraries, they won't be able to find any cards in a library. The effect applies to all opponents and all libraries, including your library.

<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>247312</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Wild Ricochet> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2013/07/01: When <Wild Ricochet> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. The controller of the original spell retains control of that spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2013/07/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Volcanic Geyser does), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/07/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Wild Ricochet>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/07/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Artist>Scott Chou</Artist>
<Multiverseid>247545</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: You may ignore a Trap's alternative cost condition and simply cast it for its normal mana cost. This is true even if its alternative cost condition has been met.
2009/10/01: Casting a Trap by paying its alternative cost doesn't change its mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/10/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast a Trap will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/10/01: A spell or ability destroys a permanent only if that spell or ability specifically contains the word "destroy" in its text. If a spell or ability an opponent controls exiles a noncreature permanent you control, causes you to sacrifice a noncreature permanent, removes all loyalty counters from a planeswalker you control, or causes an ability you control to trigger (and then that ability destroys a permanent you control), <Cobra Trap>'s alternative cost condition hasn't been met.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Forestcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Forest card. After you find a Forest card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>

It won't copy counters on the <Spawnwrithe>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Spawnwrithe>'s power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a <Spawnwrithe>. But if any copy effects have affected that <Spawnwrithe>, they're taken into account.
2008/05/01: If <Spawnwrithe>'s ability triggers, then <Spawnwrithe> becomes a copy of another creature before its ability resolves (due to Mirrorweave, perhaps), the token will be a copy of whatever creature the <Spawnwrithe> is currently a copy of. At the end of the turn, <Spawnwrithe> will revert back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is.
2008/05/01: If a copy effect such as Mirrorweave causes some other creature to become a copy of <Spawnwrithe>, then that creature deals combat damage to a player, the token that's put onto the battlefield is simply a copy of <Spawnwrithe>.

<Artist>Randy Gallegos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>247202</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/08/01: Casting a card by using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: You're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
2008/08/01: A retrace card cast from your graveyard follows the normal timing rules for its card type.
2008/08/01: When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.
2008/08/01: If the active player casts a spell that has retrace, that player may cast that card again after it resolves, before another player can remove the card from the graveyard. The active player has priority after the spell resolves, so they can immediately cast a new spell. Since casting a card with retrace from the graveyard moves that card onto the stack, no one else would have the chance to affect it while it's still in the graveyard.</Rulings>

<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>247165</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: <Sigil Captain>'s ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless the creature that enters the battlefield under your control is 1/1, and (2) the ability will do nothing unless that creature is still 1/1 at the time the ability resolves.
2009/05/01: For that reason, two <Sigil Captain>s don't work well together. When a 1/1 creature enters the battlefield under your control, the abilities of both <Sigil Captain>s will trigger. When the first resolves, two +1/+1 counters are put on the 1/1 creature. When the second resolves, it will do nothing because the creature that entered the battlefield is now 3/3.
2009/05/01: <Sigil Captain>'s ability checks a creature's initial power and toughness upon being put on the battlefield, so it will take into account counters that it enters the battlefield with and static abilities that may give it a continuous power boost once it's on the battlefield (such as the one on Glorious Anthem). After the creature is already on the battlefield, changing its power and toughness to 1/1 with a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability won't allow this ability to trigger; it's too late by then.
2009/05/01: If, for some reason, <Sigil Captain> enters the battlefield as a 1/1 creature (due to a pair of Engineered Plagues, for example), it will cause its own ability to trigger.</Rulings>

2011/09/22: Skullbriar retains all counters, not just +1/+1 counters.
2011/09/22: The counters that remain on Skullbriar as it changes zones aren't "placed" on Skullbriar. Effects like Doubling Season's and Melira, Sylvok Outcast's won't affect those counters.
2011/09/22: Counters that adjust power and/or toughness affect Skullbriar's power and/or toughness in zones other than the battlefield. For example, a Skullbriar in the command zone with a +1/+1 counter on it will be 2/2.
2011/09/22: Effects that last "for as long as that creature has a [kind of] counter on it," such as Aven Mimeomancer's, stop applying to Skullbriar once it leaves the battlefield. Even though Skullbriar retains the counters, it becomes a new object with no relation to its last existence in its previous zone.
2011/09/22: Skullbriar's last ability only works if it has that ability in the zone it's moving from. For example, with Yixlid Jailer ("Cards in graveyards lose all abilities") on the battlefield, a Skullbriar with a counter on it in a graveyard loses that counter when it's put onto the battlefield. Conversely, that Skullbriar moving from the graveyard to the battlefield would retain that counter if Humility ("All creatures lose all abilities and are 1/1") were on the battlefield; if Skullbriar then left the battlefield with Humility still on the battlefield, it would lose the counter.
2011/09/22: If a card becomes a copy of Skullbriar, counters will remain on that card when it leaves the battlefield (unless it goes to your hand or library). Once it does so, it stops being a copy of Skullbriar, so those counters will cease to exist when that card next changes zones.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>
