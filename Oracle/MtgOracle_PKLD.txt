Whenever Aetherstorm Roc or another creature enters the battlefield under your control, you get {E} (an energy counter).
Whenever Aetherstorm Roc attacks, you may pay {E}{E}. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on it and tap up to one target creature defending player controls.</CardText>
<Artist>Scott Murphy</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: <Aetherstorm Roc>'s second triggered ability resolves before blockers are chosen. A creature tapped this way won't be able to block.
2016/09/20: You don't have to target a creature with <Aetherstorm Roc>'s last ability. If you do choose a target, and that target becomes illegal, the ability doesn't resolve and you won't be able to pay {E}{E} to put a counter on <Aetherstorm Roc>.
2016/09/20: A creature entering the battlefield at the same time as <Aetherstorm Roc> causes its first triggered ability to trigger.
2017/02/09: If a triggered ability with one or more targets states that you "may pay" some amount of {E}, and each permanent that it targets has become an illegal target, the ability doesn't resolve. You can't pay {E} even if you want to.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect. You simply choose whether or not to pay that amount of {E} as the ability resolves, and no player may take actions to try to stop the ability's effect after you make your choice.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.</Rulings>

Fabricate 2 (When this creature enters the battlefield, put two +1/+1 counters on it or create two 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature tokens.)
Other creatures you control get +1/+1.</CardText>
<Artist>Volkan Baǵa</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: You choose whether to put +1/+1 counters on the creature or create Servo tokens as the fabricate ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose and the time that counters are added or tokens are created.
2016/09/20: Fabricate doesn't cause the creature with the ability to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters already on it. For example, Weaponcraft Enthusiast will enter the battlefield as a 0/1 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.
2016/09/20: If you can't put +1/+1 counters on the creature for any reason as fabricate resolves (for instance, if it's no longer on the battlefield), you just create Servo tokens.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: When you attach <Captured by the Consulate> to an opponent's creature, you still control <Captured by the Consulate>. Its last ability triggers whenever your opponents cast a spell with a single target, not when an opponent of the creature's controller casts a spell with a single target.
2016/09/20: When a player casts an Aura spell, it targets the creature that it will enchant and may cause <Captured by the Consulate>'s last ability to trigger.
2016/09/20: If a spell has multiple targets, it doesn't have a single target even if the same object is chosen for each of those targets.
2016/09/20: If the spell can't target the enchanted creature, its target remains unchanged.
2016/09/20: If there is more than one <Captured by the Consulate> on the battlefield, the triggered ability of each one will change the target if able. The last one to resolve determines what that spell finally targets. If one player controls more than one Capture by the Consulate, they choose the order in which they resolve. If multiple players control those Auras, the first player among them in turn order (starting with the player whose turn it is now) is the one whose triggered ability resolves last.

<Artist>Victor Adame Minguez</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: First the player whose turn it is chooses permanents they control, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by players who chose before them. All of the unchosen nonland permanents are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/09/20: A permanent with more than one type may be chosen as either of the types or both. For example, an artifact creature may be chosen as the artifact, the creature, or both. Choosing the same permanent twice this way has the same result as choosing it once.
2016/09/20: <Cataclysmic Gearhulk> will be sacrificed to its own ability if you don't choose it as your artifact or your creature.
2016/09/20: Lands can't be chosen and won't be sacrificed, even if they have other types (such as an artifact land).

2016/09/20: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Incendiary Sabotage, you must pay those to cast the card.
2016/09/20: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: <Demon of Dark Schemes>'s second triggered ability triggers whenever another creature dies for any reason, not just due to the first triggered ability.
2016/09/20: If <Demon of Dark Schemes> dies at the same time as another creature, its second triggered ability triggers.
2016/09/20: If a creature's owner leaves the game after you've put that creature onto the battlefield with <Demon of Dark Schemes>'s last ability, the creature leaves with that player. If you leave the game before that player, the creature is exiled.
2016/09/20: The set of creatures affected by <Demon of Dark Schemes>'s first triggered ability is determined as the ability resolves. Creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn and noncreature permanents that become creatures later in the turn won't get -2/-2.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.

2016/09/20: An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands.

2016/09/20: If <Marionette Master>'s power is negative, the target opponent doesn't lose (or gain) life.
2016/09/20: If <Marionette Master> and an artifact you control are put into a graveyard at the same time, <Marionette Master>'s ability triggers.
2016/09/20: Artifact tokens that are sacrificed or destroyed are put into their owner's graveyard before ceasing to exist. If you controlled the token, <Marionette Master>'s last ability will trigger.
2016/09/20: You choose whether to put +1/+1 counters on the creature or create Servo tokens as the fabricate ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose and the time that counters are added or tokens are created.
2016/09/20: Fabricate doesn't cause the creature with the ability to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters already on it. For example, Weaponcraft Enthusiast will enter the battlefield as a 0/1 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.
2016/09/20: If you can't put +1/+1 counters on the creature for any reason as fabricate resolves (for instance, if it's no longer on the battlefield), you just create Servo tokens.</Rulings>

2016/09/20: You choose whether or not to have your other attacking creatures get +X/+X as <Cultivator of Blades>'s triggered ability resolves, not as you put it onto the stack.

For example, Weaponcraft Enthusiast will enter the battlefield as a 0/1 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.

2016/09/20: Rashmi's ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. If you cast a spell using the ability, it will also resolve before the initial spell.
2016/09/20: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost. For cards in your library with {X} in their mana costs, X is considered to be 0.
2016/09/20: If Rashmi's ability resolves and the spell that caused it to trigger has been countered, use that spell's converted mana cost as it last existed on the stack to determine whether or not you may cast the top card of your library.

<Rulings>2016/09/20: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/09/20: The token is an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value of the token that other effects may copy. Haste and the ability's delayed triggered ability aren't copiable.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent is copying something else (for example, if the copied permanent is an Altered Ego), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent copied.
2016/09/20: If the copied permanent is a token, the token created with Saheeli copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created that token.
2016/09/20: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2016/09/20: As Saheeli's last ability resolves, all three artifacts enter the battlefield at the same time. Triggered abilities of any of those artifacts will see all three entering the battlefield. Replacement effects, such as that of Sculpting Steel, won't see the others on the battlefield as they are being applied.

2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: Once a player has announced an ability, <Deadlock Trap> can't be used to undo it. The last ability must be activated before that player activates that ability.
2016/09/20: Players may respond to <Deadlock Trap>'s last ability by activating an ability of the target permanent if that ability's timing permissions allow it.
2016/09/20: After a planeswalker enters the battlefield, the active player receives priority and may activate an ability of that planeswalker before any player can activate <Deadlock Trap>'s last ability.
2016/09/20: A tapped planeswalker can be attacked or dealt damage as normal.
2016/09/20: If the tapped creature somehow becomes untapped, it can attack and block as normal, but its abilities still can't be activated this turn.
2016/09/20: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.

2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.

<Artist>Kirsten Zirngibl</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: <Ghirapur Orrery>'s first ability allows a player to play an additional land during their main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands.
2016/09/20: <Ghirapur Orrery>'s first ability is cumulative if more than one is on the battlefield.
2016/09/20: No player may take actions in a turn before <Ghirapur Orrery>'s second ability checks to see if it should trigger. If the player whose turn it is has any cards in hand, it won't trigger.
2016/09/20: If the player has any cards in hand as <Ghirapur Orrery>'s second ability resolves, the ability does nothing. Notably, a second <Ghirapur Orrery> won't have a player draw another three cards unless the player empties their hand after resolving the first one's trigger.
2016/09/20: The draw step is after the upkeep step, so drawing a card as a turn-based action won't affect whether <Ghirapur Orrery>'s second ability triggers.

<CardText>If an artifact or creature entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</CardText>
<Flavor>All who listen hear their own song, a unique melody played just for them.</Flavor>
<Artist>Volkan Baǵa</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: <Panharmonicon> affects an artifact or creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when an artifact or creature enters the battlefield. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2016/09/20: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield with counters on it, are unaffected.
2016/09/20: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with Clone, are unaffected.
2016/09/20: <Panharmonicon>'s effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes it to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put it onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to get counters or Servos for fabricate, are also made individually.
2016/09/20: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "artifacts" or "creatures." For example, Amulet of Vigor says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would trigger twice. If a land (that isn't also an artifact or a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would trigger only once.
2016/09/20: Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if you control Mycosynth Lattice, which says, in part, "All permanents are artifacts in addition to their other types," an enchantment entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger an additional time.
2016/09/20: If you control two <Panharmonicon>s, an artifact or creature entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third <Panharmonicon> causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
2016/09/20: <Panharmonicon> affects triggered abilities of permanents you control that trigger when an artifact or creature enters the battlefield under any player's control, not just yours.
2016/09/20: If <Panharmonicon> and an artifact or creature enter the battlefield at the same time, those permanents entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger an additional time.
2016/09/20: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability. For example, if Isochron Scepter's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice and two instant cards are exiled, both will be copied when its second ability is activated. You may cast either or both of the copies in any order.
2016/09/20: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>

2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: No player may take actions in a turn before <Inventors' Fair>'s triggered ability checks to see if it should trigger. If you don't control three or more artifacts, it won't trigger.
2016/09/20: If you control three artifacts as the ability resolves, you gain 1 life. The artifacts you control as the ability resolves don't have to be the same ones you controlled as it triggered. If you don't control three artifacts at that time, you won't gain life.
2016/09/20: When using <Inventors' Fair>'s activated ability, the number of artifacts you control is checked only as you activate it. It's not checked again as the ability resolves.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. These cards have the Planeswalker symbol in their text box; this symbol has no effect on gameplay. You can read more about these events in the official Magic fiction at http://www.mtgstory.com.</Rulings>
