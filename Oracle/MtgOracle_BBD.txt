<Rulings>2018/06/08: Will's first ability overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after that ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2018/06/08: If an affected creature gains an ability after Will's first ability resolves, it will keep that ability.
2018/06/08: Effects that raise or lower a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2018/06/08: If a creature affected by Rowan's first ability can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2018/06/08: The copy of the spell created by Will's emblem resolves before the original spell. The same is true of the copy of the activated ability created by Rowan's emblem.
2018/06/08: If you have two of Will's emblems, perhaps because Rowan's emblem copied Will's last ability, each one will copy a spell you cast. The same is true of Rowan's emblem in regard to abilities you activate.
2018/06/08: The ability of either Kenrith's emblem can copy the spell or ability even if that spell or ability is countered before the emblem's triggered ability resolves.
2018/06/08: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast" or "activated." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activates an ability (such as either emblem's own ability) won't trigger.
2018/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell or ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast or activated (like Blaze does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability has damage divided as it was cast or activated (like Chandra's Pyrohelix), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/06/08: The controller of a copied spell can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Similarly, for Rowan's emblem, effects based on non-mana costs that were paid for the original ability are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/06/08: The last abilities of Will and Rowan apply to Commander games only. They have no effect in other games.
2018/06/08: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2018/06/08: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2018/06/08: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander. For more information on the Commander variant, please visit Wizards.com/Commander.
2018/06/08: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Khorvath and Sylvia are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with red and/or white in their color identity, but not blue, black, or green.
2018/06/08: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2018/06/08: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability (featured in the Magic: The Gathering—Commander™ (2016 Edition) set) or corresponding "partner with" abilities as the game begins. A creature with a "partner with" ability can't partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2018/06/08: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2018/06/08: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2018/06/08: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.
2018/06/08: Rowan's second ability targets only the player. Tapped creatures with hexproof that player controls will be dealt damage as that ability resolves.
2018/06/08: The ability of Will's emblem can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. Similarly, the ability of Rowan's emblem can copy any activated ability that isn't a mana ability. A mana ability is an ability that produces mana, not an ability that costs mana.</Rulings>

It also doesn't matter whether Regna was on the battlefield when the life gain happened.
2018/06/08: Regna's last ability has you create two tokens, regardless of which player on your team gained life, how many players on your team gained life, or how much life was gained.
2018/06/08: If your team didn't gain life during the turn before the end step begins, Regna's last ability won't trigger at all. Gaining life during the end step won't cause the ability to trigger.

2018/07/13: If an effect has a player flip a coin and refers to winning or losing a flip, only the player who flipped the coin wins or loses the flip. If that player loses the flip, nobody wins the flip.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>445975</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/06/08: Virtus's last ability triggers and resolves after combat damage is dealt. For example, if Virtus deals 1 combat damage to a player with 10 life, combat damage will reduce that player's life total to 9. Then its ability will cause the player to lose 5 life, leaving the player at 4.
2018/06/08: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player's life total is the same as their team's life total.
2018/06/08: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2018/06/08: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2018/06/08: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander. For more information on the Commander variant, please visit Wizards.com/Commander.
2018/06/08: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Khorvath and Sylvia are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with red and/or white in their color identity, but not blue, black, or green.
2018/06/08: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2018/06/08: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability (featured in the Magic: The Gathering—Commander™ (2016 Edition) set) or corresponding "partner with" abilities as the game begins. A creature with a "partner with" ability can't partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2018/06/08: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2018/06/08: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2018/06/08: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.
2018/06/08: If only one creature can block Gorm the Great, that creature does so.
2018/06/08: If a creature can't block Gorm for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having it block Gorm, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block in that case either. If this means that no creatures block Gorm, Gorm isn't blocked.</Rulings>

2018/06/08: The designation of friend or foe is only relevant to the spell that asks you to choose. A player you call your friend doesn't become your teammate, and the next "friend or foe" spell you cast could name that player your foe.
2018/06/08: You may call a player a friend or a foe even if that player will be instructed to perform an impossible action. For example, for <Regna's Sanction>, a foe may control no untapped creatures.
2018/06/08: Friends perform their specified actions before foes. This means that a friend's action may cause a triggered ability of a foe's permanent to trigger before that foe's action causes that permanent to leave the battlefield.

<Artist>Bayard Wu</Artist>
<Multiverseid>446011</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/06/08: When <Zndrsplt's Judgment> resolves and you choose friend or foe, first the next friend in turn order (or, if it's a friend's turn, that friend) chooses a creature they control, then each other friend in turn order does the same, then each of those players create a token at the same time. Friends will know choices made by earlier players when making their choices. Repeat this process for foes, who choose a creature one at a time and then return them all to their owners' hands at the same time.
2018/06/08: Each token copies exactly what is printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2018/06/08: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/06/08: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2018/06/08: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is an Evil Twin), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2018/06/08: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2018/06/08: You make this choice for yourself as well as each other player. In some rare cases, you may wish to call yourself (or your teammate in a Two-Headed Giant game) a foe. You can do that.
2018/06/08: The designation of friend or foe is only relevant to the spell that asks you to choose. A player you call your friend doesn't become your teammate, and the next "friend or foe" spell you cast could name that player your foe.
2018/06/08: You may call a player a friend or a foe even if that player will be instructed to perform an impossible action. For example, for Regna's Sanction, a foe may control no untapped creatures.
2018/06/08: Friends perform their specified actions before foes. This means that a friend's action may cause a triggered ability of a foe's permanent to trigger before that foe's action causes that permanent to leave the battlefield.
2018/06/08: Players can't take actions in between the time that friends perform their actions and the time that foes perform theirs. If any abilities trigger from friends performing actions, those triggers won't be put onto the stack until the foes perform their actions and the spell finishes resolving.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/06/08: <Archfiend of Despair>'s last ability counts only how much life was lost. It doesn't care whether a player also gained life.
2018/06/08: The amount of life to lose is determined only as <Archfiend of Despair>'s triggered ability resolves. For example, if you control two of them and an opponent lost 3 life earlier in the turn, the first ability to resolve would have that player lose 3 life, and the second would have that player lose 6 life.
2018/06/08: In a Two-Headed Giant game, damage and life loss happen to each player individually. If each player on a team is dealt 2 damage, each of those players loses 2 life and the team's life total goes down by 4. When <Archfiend of Despair>'s ability resolves, each of those players again loses 2 life and the team's life total goes down again by 4; they don't each lose 4 life.</Rulings>

2018/06/08: If an effect says that an opponent wins the game, <Stunning Reversal>'s effect doesn't apply.
2018/06/08: <Stunning Reversal>'s effect does nothing if you concede the game. A player who concedes leaves the game.
2018/06/08: <Stunning Reversal>'s effect applies any time you would lose the game, even if you're not losing due to your life total being 0 or less.
2018/06/08: For your life total to become 1, you gain or lose the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is 4 when <Stunning Reversal>'s effect applies, it will cause you to lose 3 life; alternatively, if your life total is -5 when it applies, it will cause you to gain 6 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2018/06/08: If you have fewer than seven cards in your library, you'll lose the game immediately after applying <Stunning Reversal>'s replacement effect.
2018/06/08: If each player would lose the game at the same time, but <Stunning Reversal>'s effect applies to you losing the game, you win the game as soon as everyone else has lost the game. This is true even if you'd lose the game immediately afterwards, perhaps because you don't have seven cards in your library to draw or because you couldn't gain life to raise your life total to 1.
2018/06/08: In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a rule or effect says that your team or your teammate loses the game, your team won't lose the game, but only you draw seven cards and only you gain or lose life to make your team's life total become 1.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/06/08: <Bonus Round>'s ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2018/06/08: The controller of the spell that caused <Bonus Round>'s ability to trigger also controls the copy.
2018/06/08: A copy is created even if the spell that caused <Bonus Round>'s ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copy resolves before the original spell.

2018/06/08: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. Its controller can't choose a different one.
2018/06/08: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2018/06/08: The controller of the copy can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2018/06/08: The copy that <Bonus Round>'s ability creates is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Bonus Round>'s ability itself) won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/06/08: The enters-the-battlefield effect of <Archon of Valor's Reach> is a replacement effect that doesn't use the stack. No player can cast spells or activate abilities after it has entered the battlefield but before you choose a card type.
2018/06/08: Whether it's legal to cast a spell is determined before its costs are paid. This means that if <Archon of Valor's Reach> has sorcery as the chosen type, you can't cast Morbid Curiosity, even if you wish to sacrifice <Archon of Valor's Reach> to do so.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>446046</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/06/08: You may reveal a card with assist and discuss how to pay for it before you begin to cast the spell. Targets are chosen for that spell before you choose another player to help you pay for it and before that player has committed any mana to doing so.
2018/06/08: Only the generic mana portion of a spell's cost can be paid with assist. Any colored mana costs must be paid by the spell's controller, even if the assisting player paid mana of that color.
2018/06/08: If an effect allows a player to cast a spell spending mana "as though it were mana of any color" or "of any type," that player must still pay for the colored mana in that spell's total cost. That cost doesn't become generic.
2018/06/08: Assist allows another player to pay for any amount of generic mana. If an effect changes the cost of the spell, the amount that player may pay will be more or less than the amount in the spell's reminder text.</Rulings>

(The same is true for Fortifications controlled by the chosen player, if <True-Name Nemesis> becomes a land.) — <True-Name Nemesis> can't be blocked by creatures controlled by the chosen player. — All damage that would be dealt to <True-Name Nemesis> by sources controlled by the chosen player is prevented.

<Multiverseid>446121</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: <Nyxathid> tracks the hand size of the chosen player even if that player ceases to be an opponent of its controller. (This could happen if that player gains control of <Nyxathid>, for example.)
2009/02/01: In a multiplayer game, if the chosen player leaves the game, <Nyxathid>'s second ability simply won't do anything anymore.
2009/02/01: <Nyxathid>'s two abilities are linked: The second one refers only to the player chosen by the first one. If another creature becomes a copy of <Nyxathid> (due to Mirrorweave, for example), the second ability won't do anything because a player was never chosen as a result of the first ability. This is true even if a different ability allowed a player to be chosen as that creature entered the battlefield.
2009/02/01: If a spell or ability causes the chosen player to draw cards and then discard cards, <Nyxathid>'s power and toughness changes accordingly as that spell or ability is resolving. For example, if the chosen player has five cards in hand and a spell causes that player to draw two cards then discard two cards, <Nyxathid> will start out as 2/2, then become 1/1, 0/0, and finally 2/2. This is because cards are always drawn one at a time, but multiple cards may be discarded at once. Although <Nyxathid> momentarily had 0 toughness while that spell was resolving, it isn't put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action because state-based actions aren't checked until the spell has finished resolving.</Rulings>

2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: The activated ability that <Evil Twin> gains as part of its copy effect is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.

2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is a token, <Evil Twin> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Evil Twin> is not a token in this case.
2017/03/14: Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named "Beast."
2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.

<Rulings>2004/12/01: <Mycosynth Lattice> turns all permanents on the battlefield into artifacts. Spells on the stack and cards in other zones aren't permanents, so those spells and cards don't become artifacts.
2004/12/01: <Mycosynth Lattice>'s second ability makes everything, in every zone of the game, colorless.
2004/12/01: The Lattice's third ability lets players spend even colorless mana as though it had a color. However, it doesn't remove restrictions on the mana. For example, <Mycosynth Lattice> doesn't allow mana from Vedalken Engineer to be used to cast a nonartifact spell.
2009/10/01: The Lattice's first ability causes Auras to become artifacts. Combined with March of the Machines from the Mirrodin set, this can then make those Auras become creatures. An Aura that's also a creature can't enchant anything. It's unattached the next time state-based actions are checked, and then immediately put into its owner's graveyard as a second state-based action.</Rulings>

-8: Target player gets an emblem with "Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy."
Partner with Rowan Kenrith
Will Kenrith can be your commander.</CardText>
<Artist>Anna Steinbauer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>446223</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/06/08: Will's first ability overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after that ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2018/06/08: If an affected creature gains an ability after Will's first ability resolves, it will keep that ability.
2018/06/08: Effects that raise or lower a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2018/06/08: If a creature affected by Rowan's first ability can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2018/06/08: The copy of the spell created by Will's emblem resolves before the original spell. The same is true of the copy of the activated ability created by Rowan's emblem.
2018/06/08: If you have two of Will's emblems, perhaps because Rowan's emblem copied Will's last ability, each one will copy a spell you cast. The same is true of Rowan's emblem in regard to abilities you activate.
2018/06/08: The ability of either Kenrith's emblem can copy the spell or ability even if that spell or ability is countered before the emblem's triggered ability resolves.
2018/06/08: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast" or "activated." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activates an ability (such as either emblem's own ability) won't trigger.
2018/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell or ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast or activated (like Blaze does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability has damage divided as it was cast or activated (like Chandra's Pyrohelix), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/06/08: The controller of a copied spell can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Similarly, for Rowan's emblem, effects based on non-mana costs that were paid for the original ability are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/06/08: The last abilities of Will and Rowan apply to Commander games only. They have no effect in other games.
2018/06/08: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2018/06/08: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2018/06/08: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander. For more information on the Commander variant, please visit Wizards.com/Commander.
2018/06/08: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Khorvath and Sylvia are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with red and/or white in their color identity, but not blue, black, or green.
2018/06/08: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2018/06/08: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability (featured in the Magic: The Gathering—Commander™ (2016 Edition) set) or corresponding "partner with" abilities as the game begins. A creature with a "partner with" ability can't partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2018/06/08: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2018/06/08: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2018/06/08: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.
2018/06/08: Rowan's second ability targets only the player. Tapped creatures with hexproof that player controls will be dealt damage as that ability resolves.
2018/06/08: The ability of Will's emblem can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. Similarly, the ability of Rowan's emblem can copy any activated ability that isn't a mana ability. A mana ability is an ability that produces mana, not an ability that costs mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/06/08: Rowan's second ability targets only the player. Tapped creatures with hexproof that player controls will be dealt damage as that ability resolves.
2018/06/08: The ability of Will's emblem can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. Similarly, the ability of Rowan's emblem can copy any activated ability that isn't a mana ability. A mana ability is an ability that produces mana, not an ability that costs mana.
2018/06/08: The copy of the spell created by Will's emblem resolves before the original spell. The same is true of the copy of the activated ability created by Rowan's emblem.
2018/06/08: If you have two of Will's emblems, perhaps because Rowan's emblem copied Will's last ability, each one will copy a spell you cast. The same is true of Rowan's emblem in regard to abilities you activate.
2018/06/08: The ability of either Kenrith's emblem can copy the spell or ability even if that spell or ability is countered before the emblem's triggered ability resolves.
2018/06/08: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast" or "activated." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activates an ability (such as either emblem's own ability) won't trigger.
2018/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell or ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast or activated (like Blaze does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/06/08: If the spell or ability has damage divided as it was cast or activated (like Chandra's Pyrohelix), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/06/08: The controller of a copied spell can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Similarly, for Rowan's emblem, effects based on non-mana costs that were paid for the original ability are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/06/08: The last abilities of Will and Rowan apply to Commander games only. They have no effect in other games.
2018/06/08: "Partner with [name]" represents two abilities. The first is a triggered ability: "When this permanent enters the battlefield, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their library."
2018/06/08: Note that the target player searches their library (which may be affected by effects such as that of Stranglehold) and that the card they find is revealed, even though these words aren't included in the ability's reminder text.
2018/06/08: The second ability represented by the "partner with [name]" keyword modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant and has no function outside of that variant. If a legendary creature card with "partner with [name]" is designated as your commander, the named legendary creature card can also be designated as your commander. For more information on the Commander variant, please visit Wizards.com/Commander.
2018/06/08: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Khorvath and Sylvia are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with red and/or white in their color identity, but not blue, black, or green.
2018/06/08: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2018/06/08: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability (featured in the Magic: The Gathering—Commander™ (2016 Edition) set) or corresponding "partner with" abilities as the game begins. A creature with a "partner with" ability can't partner with any creature other than its designated partner. Losing a partner ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2018/06/08: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2018/06/08: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.
2018/06/08: The triggered ability of the "partner with" keyword still triggers in a Commander game. If your other commander has somehow ended up in your library, you can find it. You can also target another player who might have that card in their library.
2018/06/08: Will's first ability overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after that ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2018/06/08: If an affected creature gains an ability after Will's first ability resolves, it will keep that ability.
2018/06/08: Effects that raise or lower a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2018/06/08: If a creature affected by Rowan's first ability can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.</Rulings>
