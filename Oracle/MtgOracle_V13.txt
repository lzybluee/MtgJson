<Flavor>There is always a greater power.</Flavor>
<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>373318</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Cruel Ultimatum>'s only target is an opponent. You don't choose which creature card in your graveyard you'll return to your hand until <Cruel Ultimatum> resolves.
2017/03/14: All of the actions for <Cruel Ultimatum> are performed sequentially, in the order listed. Earlier actions may affect how you perform later actions. For example, if the opponent sacrifices a creature that they control but you own, it will end up in your graveyard. When <Cruel Ultimatum> lets you return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, you can choose that one.
2017/03/14: If, as <Cruel Ultimatum> begins to resolve, your opponent's life total is 5 or less and you have two or fewer cards in your library, the game will result in a draw. Your opponent's life total will drop to 0 or less, but <Cruel Ultimatum> must finish resolving completely before state-based actions are performed. You'll then be forced to draw three cards and fail to draw one. When state-based actions are finally performed, you and your opponent will both lose the game at the same time, which means the game is a draw.</Rulings>

2016/06/08: In most cases, if you own <Green Sun's Zenith> and cast it, you'll shuffle your library twice. In practice, shuffling once is sufficient, but effects that care about you shuffling your library (like Psychogenic Probe, for example) will see that you've shuffled twice.
2016/06/08: If you own <Green Sun's Zenith>, but an opponent casts it (due to Knowledge Pool's effect, for example), that opponent searches their library for an appropriate creature card, then shuffles that library. That opponent then shuffles <Green Sun's Zenith> into your library. You won't shuffle any library in this case.</Rulings>
