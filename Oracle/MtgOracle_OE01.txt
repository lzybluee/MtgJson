<Type>Ongoing Scheme</Type>
<CardText>(An ongoing scheme remains face up until it's abandoned.)
Spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.
At the beginning of your opponents' end step, if they cast four or more spells this turn, abandon this scheme.</CardText>
<Artist>Adrian Majkrzak</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430646</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/06/13: Abilities that reduce the cost of a spell apply after abilities that raise them. For example, Borrowed Malevolence with both modes chosen costs {1}{B} to cast if this scheme is face up.
2017/06/13: Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of a spell can't reduce that spell's colored mana requirements.
2017/06/13: If an instant or sorcery spell has {X} in its mana cost, choose the value for X first, then reduce the cost by {1}. For example, Volcanic Geyser with X chosen as 4 costs {3}{R}{R} to cast if this scheme is face up.
2017/06/13: For this scheme's second ability to trigger, the players on the opposing team must have cast four spells total among them.
2017/06/13: If an opponent cast a spell during the opposing team's turn and then left the game, that spell counts when determining whether the last ability of this scheme triggers.
2017/06/13: The second ability only checks that four or more spells were cast. It doesn't matter if those spells are countered or fail to resolve for other reasons.
2017/06/13: In a Supervillain Rumble game, the last ability of this scheme triggers at the beginning of each opponent's end step if that player alone has cast four or more spells that turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/06/13: This scheme's first ability isn't a mana ability. Opponents may respond to it before you have that mana.
2017/06/13: This scheme adds mana during your precombat main phase. If you don't spend it before you move to your combat step, it will empty from your mana pool as your main phase ends.
2017/06/13: The number of lands you control is checked as you set this scheme in motion and again as its second ability resolves. Once this scheme has been set in motion, you can't play a land or use an effect to put one onto the battlefield before the second ability could trigger.</Rulings>

Creatures the chosen player controls can't attack you or planeswalkers you control.
At the beginning of your opponents' end step, they may tap any number of untapped creatures they control with total power 8 or greater. If they do, abandon this scheme.</CardText>

<Rulings>2017/06/13: If the chosen player leaves the game, this scheme isn't abandoned, but its middle ability won't have any effect anymore. You won't choose a new player.
2017/06/13: If multiple abilities trigger at the beginning of your opponents' end step, first their abilities are put onto the stack in any order, and then you put your abilities onto the stack in any order. Your abilities resolve before theirs do.
2017/06/13: To pay the cost of this scheme's second ability, your opponents collectively need to tap creatures with total power 8 or greater. Those creatures may be controlled by different teammates.
2017/06/13: Your opponents may tap creatures that came under their control this turn to pay the cost of this scheme's last ability.
2017/06/13: Once your opponents have chosen to tap creatures, you can't take any action until they're tapped and this scheme has been abandoned.
2017/06/13: In a Supervillain Rumble game, this scheme's last ability triggers at the beginning of each opponent's end step. Only that player may tap untapped creatures they control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/06/13: You choose one opponent to make the final choice of which pile is put into your hand, but all players may discuss and advise this choice.
2017/06/13: You don't have to reveal the cards in the face-down pile, no matter which zone they're put into. Resist the urge to gloat at the heroes if their decision serves your master plan.
2017/06/13: The split doesn't have to be even. The piles can be split with a single card in one pile and three cards in another. A pile can even have zero cards in it—in this case, an opponent chooses whether to put all the cards into your hand or into your library.</Rulings>

2017/06/13: If one of these creatures can't attack its player during a given turn (perhaps because that player has left the game, or because a member of the opposing team has gained control of it), it may attack another player, attack a planeswalker an opponent controls, or not attack at all. If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack its player, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it may attack another player, attack a planeswalker an opponent controls, or not attack at all.</Rulings>
