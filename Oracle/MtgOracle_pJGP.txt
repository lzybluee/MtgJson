<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: You can cast this with X=0.
2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability is countered (with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

You can choose to target the "at the beginning of the end step" trigger when it is placed on the stack at end of turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chuck Lukacs</Artist>
<Rulings>2005/10/01: The tokens and counters that <Doubling Season> creates are exact copies of the kind of tokens and counters that were being created in the first place.
2005/10/01: <Doubling Season> affects cards that "enter the battlefield with" a certain number of counters. Triskelion, for example, would enter the battlefield with six +1/+1 counters on it rather than three.
2005/10/01: If there are two <Doubling Season>s on the battlefield, then the number of tokens or counters is four times the original number. If there are three on the battlefield, then the number of tokens or counters is eight times the original number, and so on.
2005/10/01: Planeswalkers will enter the battlefield with double the normal amount of loyalty counters. However, if you activate an ability whose cost has you put loyalty counters on a planeswalker, the number you put on isn't doubled. This is because those counters are put on as a cost, not as an effect.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flash
When Dualcaster Mage enters the battlefield, copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Flavor>"It has been my experience that disasters like to strike in pairs."</Flavor>
<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Dualcaster Mage>'s triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2016/06/08: As <Dualcaster Mage>'s triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/06/08: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<CardText>{2}{R}, {T}: Create a token that's a copy of target creature card in your graveyard, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types. It gains haste. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Flavor>"She will come back to me."</Flavor>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/07: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature card (except that the copy is also an artifact) and nothing else.
2014/11/07: If the copied creature card has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/07: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature card will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature card will also work.
2014/11/07: If another creature becomes a copy of, or enters the battlefield as a copy of, the token, that creature will copy the creature card the token is copying, except it will also be an artifact. This is true even if the creature card that was copied by <Feldon of the Third Path> is no longer in the graveyard at that time. However, the new copy won't gain haste and you won't sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.
2014/11/07: If Feldon's ability creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (such as the one Doubling Season creates), each of those tokens will gain haste and you'll sacrifice each of them.</Rulings>

—Nicol Bolas</Flavor>
<Artist>Mike Bierek</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: <Mana Drain> can target a spell that can't be countered. When <Mana Drain> resolves, that spell won't be countered, but you'll still add mana to your mana pool at the beginning of your next main phase.
2017/11/17: If the target spell is an illegal target when <Mana Drain> tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any mana.
2017/11/17: <Mana Drain>'s delayed triggered ability will usually trigger at the beginning of your precombat main phase. However, if you cast <Mana Drain> during your precombat main phase or during your combat phase, its delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of that turn's postcombat main phase.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: If you cast a commander from your hand, the additional cost based on the number of times you've cast it from your command zone (sometimes referred to as the "commander tax") doesn't apply. Additionally, that casting won't add to the tax if you later cast the commander from the command zone.
2015/11/04: If your commander isn't in the command zone (or you're not playing Commander) as the last ability resolves, nothing happens.
2016/11/08: If you have two commanders with the partner ability in the command zone, <Command Beacon>'s effect puts one of your choice into your hand, not both.</Rulings>
