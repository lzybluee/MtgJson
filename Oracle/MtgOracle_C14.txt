<Rulings>2014/11/07: Creatures that were declared as attackers or entered the battlefield attacking continue to be attacking creatures until the combat phase ends. It's possible to exile all attacking creatures after they've dealt combat damage if you cast <Angel of the Dire Hour> during the combat damage step or end of combat step.
2014/11/07: If you cast <Angel of the Dire Hour> outside of combat, its triggered ability will trigger but have no effect.
2014/11/07: If a spell or ability instructs you to put <Angel of the Dire Hour> onto the battlefield from your hand, that means you won't have cast it, so its triggered ability won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/07: Lieutenant abilities apply only if your commander is on the battlefield and under your control.
2014/11/07: Lieutenant abilities refer only to whether you control your commander, not any other player's commander.

2014/11/07: If you lose control of your commander, lieutenant abilities of creatures you control will immediately stop applying. If this causes a creature's toughness to become less than or equal to the amount of damage marked on it, the creature will be destroyed.
2014/11/07: If a triggered ability granted by a lieutenant ability triggers, and in response to that trigger you lose control of your commander (causing the lieutenant to lose that ability), that triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/07: In some unusual cases, the Spirit tokens will have a toughness of 0 or less as they enter the battlefield, perhaps because an opponent controls an enchantment that gives your creatures -1/-1.

<Rulings>2016/06/08: The copy of <Malicious Affliction> is created on the stack. It's not cast, so the copy won't cause the morbid ability to trigger again.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same target as the original spell unless you choose a new one. You don't have to change this target if you don't want to or can't choose a new legal target (perhaps because there are no other nonblack creatures on the battlefield).</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having <Raving Dead> attack the chosen player, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack that player in that case either.
2014/11/07: If <Raving Dead> can't attack the chosen player for one of the above reasons but it can still attack elsewhere, you may choose to have it attack another player, attack a planeswalker, or not attack at all.
2014/11/07: If your turn has multiple combat phases, <Raving Dead>'s ability triggers at the beginning of each of them. Ignore any choices made during previous combat phases that turn.

<Artist>Aaron Miller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389441</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/07: <Bitter Feud> applies to damage dealt by any source controlled by one of the chosen players, not just combat damage.
2014/11/07: The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage. This is usually the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, although it will never be the ability itself. Usually the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
2014/11/07: If there are two <Bitter Feud>s on the battlefield, and the same two players were chosen for each, damage dealt will be doubled for each. So, two <Bitter Feud>s will end up multiplying the damage by four, three will multiply the damage by eight, and four by sixteen.
2014/11/07: If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage, or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage, chooses the order in which to apply the effects. For example, the ability of Decorated Griffin says "{1}{W}: Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn." Suppose you control a Decorated Griffin, and you and an opponent are the chosen players for a <Bitter Feud>. If a creature that player controls would deal 3 combat damage to you, and Decorated Griffin's ability has resolved once, you can choose to either (a) apply the effect from Decorated Griffin first and prevent 1 damage, and then let <Bitter Feud>'s effect double the remaining 2 damage, for a result 4 damage being dealt to you, or (b) let <Bitter Feud>'s effect apply first and double the damage to 6, and then apply the effect from Decorated Griffin to prevent 1 damage, for a result of 5 damage being dealt to you.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Dualcaster Mage>'s triggered ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2016/06/08: As <Dualcaster Mage>'s triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell on the stack. The copy isn't cast, so abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2016/06/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/06/08: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2016/06/08: If the spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/06/08: If the spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2016/06/08: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2014/11/07: If another creature becomes a copy of, or enters the battlefield as a copy of, the token, that creature will copy the creature card the token is copying, except it will also be an artifact. This is true even if the creature card that was copied by <Feldon of the Third Path> is no longer in the graveyard at that time. However, the new copy won't gain haste and you won't sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.

<Multiverseid>389553</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/07: You determine the value for X and announce how damage will be divided as you cast <Impact Resonance>. Each chosen target must receive at least 1 damage. Once the value of X is determined, it won't change, even if a source deals a greater amount of damage before <Impact Resonance> resolves. (Most of the time, the value of X in an effect would be determined only as the spell resolves. However, the rules state that if damage needs to be "divided," that information is checked as the spell is put on the stack.)
2014/11/07: <Impact Resonance> looks at the entire turn to see the greatest amount of damage dealt from a single source to a single permanent or player. For example, if the only damage dealt during the turn was Earthquake, which dealt 5 damage to each of four creatures and two players, then X is 5.
2014/11/07: If <Impact Resonance> has multiple targets, and some, but not all, of them become illegal before <Impact Resonance> resolves, <Impact Resonance> will still deal damage to the remaining legal targets according to the original damage division.</Rulings>

2014/11/07: If you lose control of your commander, lieutenant abilities of creatures you control will immediately stop applying. If this causes a creature's toughness to become less than or equal to the amount of damage marked on it, the creature will be destroyed.

Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Erica Yang</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389617</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Spectral Procession> is white even if you spend six blue mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Spectral Procession> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {W}{W}{W} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Spectral Procession> by spending {W}{W}{W}, {2}{W}{W}, {4}{W}, or {6}.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389731</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>389456</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is an Evil Twin), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.

<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389481</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389557</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: <Infinite Reflection> can enchant a creature controlled by another player.
2012/05/01: If <Infinite Reflection> enters the battlefield attached to a creature and then becomes attached to a different creature before its enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, each other nontoken creature you control will become a copy of the first creature.
2012/05/01: If <Infinite Reflection> leaves the battlefield or becomes attached to a different creature, none of the copy effects end. Your creatures will still be copies of whatever creature each was a copy of.
2012/05/01: If <Infinite Reflection> enters the battlefield attached to a token creature, the nontoken creatures that become copies of that creature are not themselves tokens.
2012/05/01: Creatures you control don't copy whether the enchanted creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2012/05/01: Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of the enchanted creature, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger. However, if the enchanted creature has any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities, those will trigger.
2012/05/01: Replacement effects that modify how a permanent enters the battlefield are now applied in the following order: control-changing effects (such as Gather Specimens), then copy effects (such as the abilities of <Infinite Reflection> and Clone), then all other effects.
2012/05/01: If a creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and <Infinite Reflection>'s. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of the enchanted creature when it enters the battlefield.
2012/05/01: Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be a copy of the enchanted creature at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, if the enchanted creature is Serra Angel, a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of Serra Angel, and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as a copy of Serra Angel with no counters.
2012/05/01: External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls Urabrask the Hidden, which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped copy of the enchanted creature.
2012/05/01: If you control more than one <Infinite Reflection>, you can apply those copy effects in any order. Creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>389565</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/09/25: If <Ixidron> and another creature are entering the battlefield at the same time, the other creature enters the battlefield face up.
2006/09/25: The controller of a face-down creature can look at it at any time, even if it doesn't have morph. Other players can't, but the rules for face-down permanents state that "you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other." As a result, all players must be able to figure out what each of the creatures <Ixidron> turned face down is.
2006/09/25: You turn the creatures face-down *as* <Ixidron> enters the battlefield. There is never a moment when <Ixidron> is on the battlefield and the creatures are face-up. If a creature on the battlefield has a "whenever another creature enters the battlefield" ability, it won't trigger because that creature will be face down before <Ixidron> enters the battlefield.
2006/09/25: Turning a face-down creature face-down typically has no effect; the creature's status is unchanged.
2018/04/27: Creatures turned face down by <Ixidron> are 2/2 creatures with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost. These values are copiable if an object becomes a copy of one of those creatures, and their normal values are not copiable.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Rite of Replication> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. You won't get any tokens.
2009/10/01: As the token or tokens are created, they check the printed values of the creature they're copying — or, if that creature is itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2009/10/01: The tokens see each other enter the battlefield. If they have a triggered ability that triggers when a creature enters the battlefield, they'll all trigger for one another.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The creature will lose all other colors and creature types, but it will retain any other card types (such as artifact) or supertypes (such as legendary) it may have.
2014/07/18: <Turn to Frog> overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after <Turn to Frog> resolves will overwrite this effect.
2014/07/18: <Turn to Frog> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
2014/07/18: If the affected creature gains an ability after <Turn to Frog> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2014/07/18: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2014/07/18: If one of the Theros block Gods is affected by <Turn to Frog>, it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities. If it stops being a creature, perhaps because your devotion to its color(s) decreased, it will be a legendary blue enchantment with no abilities. The way continuous effects work, the God's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes that ability is applied.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eric Peterson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389748</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The trigger occurs when you use the Morph ability to turn the card face up, or when an effect turns it face up. It will not trigger on being revealed or on leaving the battlefield.
2013/04/15: If a spell with split second is on the stack, you can still respond by turning this creature face up and targeting that spell with the trigger. This is because split second only stops players from casting spells or activating abilities, while turning a creature face up is a special action.
2018/03/16: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Willbender>'s triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s ability.</Rulings>

You keep playing.
2017/11/17: Other circumstances can still cause an opponent to lose the game, however. An opponent will lose a game if they concede, if that player is penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if that player's Magic Online® game clock runs out of time.
2017/11/17: Effects that say the game is a draw, such as the _Legends_(TM) card Divine Intervention, are not affected by <Abyssal Persecutor>.
2017/11/17: <Abyssal Persecutor> won't preclude an opponent's life total from reaching 0 or less. It will just preclude that player from losing the game as a result.
2017/11/17: If <Abyssal Persecutor> leaves the battlefield while an opponent has 0 or less life, that opponent will lose the game as a state-based action. No player can respond between the time <Abyssal Persecutor> leaves the battlefield and the time that player loses the game.
2017/11/17: Even though your opponents can't lose the game, a player can't pay an amount of life that's greater than their life total. If a player's life total is 0 or less, that player can't pay life at all, with one exception: a player may always pay 0 life.</Rulings>

The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.</Rulings>

2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from activating mana abilities.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent triggered abilities from triggering. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.

<Rulings>2017/11/17: You choose how many targets <Bogardan Hellkite>'s triggered ability has and how the damage is divided as you put the ability onto the stack. Each target must receive at least 1 damage.
2017/11/17: If some of the creatures or players are illegal targets as <Bogardan Hellkite>'s triggered ability tries to resolve, the original division of damage still applies and the damage that would have been dealt to the illegal targets is lost. It won't be dealt instead to a legal target.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: The owner of a token is the player under whose control the token was put onto the battlefield. If a token is shuffled into a player's library this way, that player shuffles before revealing the top card of that library.
2011/09/22: If the permanent is an illegal target by the time <Chaos Warp> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will occur. No library will be shuffled and no card will be revealed.
2011/09/22: A permanent card is a card with one or more of the following card types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker.
2011/09/22: If the revealed card is a permanent card but can't enter the battlefield (perhaps because it's an Aura with nothing to enchant), it remains on top of that library.
2011/09/22: If the revealed card is not a permanent card, it remains on top of that library.</Rulings>

<Artist>Larry MacDougall</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389690</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

<CardText>Epochrasite enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it if you didn't cast it from your hand.
When Epochrasite dies, exile it with three time counters on it and it gains suspend. (At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast this card without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Michael Bruinsma</Artist>
<Multiverseid>389504</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: <Epochrasite> will enter the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it if you cast it from a zone other than your hand, or if an effect let you put it directly onto the battlefield.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2010/03/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.
2010/03/01: You choose whether to pay {2} as the ability resolves. You may pay {2} only once per resolution.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Paick</Artist>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying of something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.
2011/01/01: <Steel Hellkite>'s last ability destroys only nonland permanents whose converted mana cost is exactly equal to X, and only those controlled by players who have been dealt combat damage by <Steel Hellkite> this turn.
2011/01/01: It doesn't matter who controlled those permanents at the time <Steel Hellkite> dealt combat damage, or if those permanents were even on the battlefield at that time.
2011/01/01: You may activate the last ability even if <Steel Hellkite> hasn't dealt combat damage to any players that turn. If you do, the ability won't do anything.
2011/01/01: If <Steel Hellkite>'s third ability is activated with X equal to 0, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0 the appropriate players control.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/05/01: If you target <Ghost Quarter> with its own ability, the ability won't resolve because its target is no longer on the battlefield. You won't get to search for a land card.
2011/09/22: If the targeted land is an illegal target by the time <Ghost Quarter>'s ability resolves, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. The land's controller won't get to search for a basic land card.
2013/07/01: The target land's controller gets to search for a basic land card even if that land wasn't destroyed by <Ghost Quarter>'s ability. This may happen because the land has indestructible or because it was regenerated.</Rulings>
