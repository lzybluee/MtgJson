<CardText>Whenever Frost Titan becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter that spell or ability unless its controller pays {2}.
Whenever Frost Titan enters the battlefield or attacks, tap target permanent. It doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.</CardText>
<Artist>Mike Sass</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Frost Titan>'s first ability affects each spell (including Aura spells), activated ability, and triggered ability that's controlled by an opponent and that <Frost Titan> becomes a target of.
2010/08/15: You may target any permanent with <Frost Titan>'s second ability. It's okay if that permanent is already tapped.
2010/08/15: If the permanent affected by <Frost Titan>'s second ability is untapped at the time that permanent's controller's next untap step begins, the last part of <Frost Titan>'s second ability has no effect.
2010/08/15: If the permanent affected by <Frost Titan>'s second ability changes controllers before its old controller's next untap step, <Frost Titan>'s second ability will prevent it from being untapped during its new controller's next untap step.</Rulings>

<CardText>{R}: Inferno Titan gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
Whenever Inferno Titan enters the battlefield or attacks, it deals 3 damage divided as you choose among one, two, or three targets.</CardText>
<Artist>Sam Burley</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: You divide the damage as you put <Inferno Titan>'s triggered ability on the stack, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. (In other words, as you put the ability on the stack, you choose whether to have it deal 3 damage to a single target, 2 damage to one target and 1 damage to another target, or 1 damage to each of three targets.)</Rulings>
