<Rulings>2009/05/01: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2009/05/01: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2009/05/01: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2009/05/01: You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.
2009/05/01: If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
2009/05/01: After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: If the second ability affects a creature, it doesn't cause that creature to lose any of its abilities. It just gives that creature flying as well.
2009/05/01: The affected creature remains 3/1 and has flying as long as it has a feather counter on it. The effect continues even if <Aven Mimeomancer> leaves the battlefield.
2009/05/01: You may put a feather counter on a creature that already has a feather counter on it. Doing so has no visible effect unless some other effect has changed the creature's power or toughness, or caused it to lose flying, since the last feather counter was put on it.
2009/05/01: If all feather counters on a creature are moved to a different creature, the ability doesn't follow them. The first creature stops being affected by the ability because it no longer has a feather counter on it. The second creature is not affected by the ability because <Aven Mimeomancer> didn't target it.
2009/10/01: The effect from the ability overwrites other effects that set power and/or toughness if and only if those effects existed before the ability resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves. Effects that switch the creature's power and toughness are always applied after any other power or toughness changing effects, including this one, regardless of the order in which they are created.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Casting this card by paying its alternative cost doesn't change when you can cast it. You can cast it only at the normal time you could cast an artifact spell. It also doesn't change the spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/05/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast this card will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/05/01: To satisfy the alternative cost, you may return any basic land you control to its owner's hand, regardless of that land's subtype or whether it's tapped.
2009/05/01: As you cast a spell, you get a chance to activate mana abilities before you pay that spell's costs. Therefore, you may tap a basic land for mana, then both spend that mana and return that land to your hand to pay this card's alternative cost. (Of course, you can return a different basic land instead.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Any Aura card you find with <Sovereigns of Lost Alara>'s second ability must be able to enchant the attacking creature as it currently exists. You need to check the Aura's enchant ability as well as any effects, such as protection, that would make it illegal to attach that Aura to the attacking creature.

Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.)</CardText>
<Artist>Anthony S. Waters</Artist>
<Multiverseid>185060</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2009/05/01: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2009/05/01: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2009/05/01: You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.
2009/05/01: If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
2009/05/01: After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Casting this card by paying its alternative cost doesn't change when you can cast it. You can cast it only at the normal time you could cast an artifact spell. It also doesn't change the spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/05/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast this card will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/05/01: To satisfy the alternative cost, you may return any basic land you control to its owner's hand, regardless of that land's subtype or whether it's tapped.
2009/05/01: As you cast a spell, you get a chance to activate mana abilities before you pay that spell's costs. Therefore, you may tap a basic land for mana, then both spend that mana and return that land to your hand to pay this card's alternative cost. (Of course, you can return a different basic land instead.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Casting this card by paying its alternative cost doesn't change when you can cast it. You can cast it only at the normal time you could cast an artifact spell. It also doesn't change the spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/05/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast this card will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/05/01: To satisfy the alternative cost, you may return any basic land you control to its owner's hand, regardless of that land's subtype or whether it's tapped.
2009/05/01: As you cast a spell, you get a chance to activate mana abilities before you pay that spell's costs. Therefore, you may tap a basic land for mana, then both spend that mana and return that land to your hand to pay this card's alternative cost. (Of course, you can return a different basic land instead.)</Rulings>

2009/05/01: You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.
2009/05/01: If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
2009/05/01: After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a land card of the specified land type, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/05/01: Landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/05/01: You can choose to find any card with the appropriate land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a land card with the appropriate type in your library.
2009/05/01: A landcycling ability lets you search for any card in your library with the stated land type. It doesn't have to be a basic land.
2009/05/01: You may only activate one landcycling ability at a time. You must specify which landcycling ability you are activating as you cycle this card, not as the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"One sigil awarded for valor, the other awarded for surviving Hellkite's Pass."</Flavor>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>179560</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: <Sigil Captain>'s ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless the creature that enters the battlefield under your control is 1/1, and (2) the ability will do nothing unless that creature is still 1/1 at the time the ability resolves.
2009/05/01: For that reason, two <Sigil Captain>s don't work well together. When a 1/1 creature enters the battlefield under your control, the abilities of both <Sigil Captain>s will trigger. When the first resolves, two +1/+1 counters are put on the 1/1 creature. When the second resolves, it will do nothing because the creature that entered the battlefield is now 3/3.
2009/05/01: <Sigil Captain>'s ability checks a creature's initial power and toughness upon being put on the battlefield, so it will take into account counters that it enters the battlefield with and static abilities that may give it a continuous power boost once it's on the battlefield (such as the one on Glorious Anthem). After the creature is already on the battlefield, changing its power and toughness to 1/1 with a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability won't allow this ability to trigger; it's too late by then.
2009/05/01: If, for some reason, <Sigil Captain> enters the battlefield as a 1/1 creature (due to a pair of Engineered Plagues, for example), it will cause its own ability to trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Casting this card by paying its alternative cost doesn't change when you can cast it. You can cast it only at the normal time you could cast an artifact spell. It also doesn't change the spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. The only difference is the cost you actually pay.
2009/05/01: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast this card will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay.
2009/05/01: To satisfy the alternative cost, you may return any basic land you control to its owner's hand, regardless of that land's subtype or whether it's tapped.
2009/05/01: As you cast a spell, you get a chance to activate mana abilities before you pay that spell's costs. Therefore, you may tap a basic land for mana, then both spend that mana and return that land to your hand to pay this card's alternative cost. (Of course, you can return a different basic land instead.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: <Tainted Sigil>'s ability counts the life lost by all players, including you.
2009/05/01: When <Tainted Sigil>'s ability resolves, it checks how much life each player lost over the course of the turn, then it totals that number and you gain that much life in one shot. It doesn't matter how a player lost life or what caused it. It also doesn't matter if <Tainted Sigil> wasn't on the battlefield when some or all of the life was lost.
2009/05/01: If you lose enough life to lower your life total to 0 or less, you'll lose the game as a state-based actions before you activate <Tainted Sigil>'s ability.
2009/05/01: <Tainted Sigil>'s ability checks only whether life was lost. It doesn't care whether life was also gained. For example, say one player lost 4 life during the turn and no one else lost any, but that same player also gained 6 life that turn. That player has a higher life total than they started the turn with — but <Tainted Sigil>'s ability counts only the life loss, so you'll gain 4 life.</Rulings>

2009/05/01: In order to counter two target spells, both of those spells must be on the stack at the time you cast <Double Negative>. Two spells can be on the stack at the same time as the result of an ability (such as cascade or replicate), as the result of a copy effect (such as the one from Cloven Casting or Twincast), or because a spell has been cast in response to another spell.
2009/05/01: It's unusual for a player to cast a spell in response to their own spell, and that will be specifically called out when it happens. Under normal circumstances, if a player casts a spell, it is assumed that the player passes priority afterward. If that player casts another spell, it is assumed that each other player has also passed priority, which caused the first spell to resolve and the first player to receive priority again. Unless the first player says otherwise, only one spell will be on the stack at a time in that scenario.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>180597</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2009/05/01: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2009/05/01: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2009/05/01: You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.
2009/05/01: If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
2009/05/01: After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.
2009/05/01: After <Enigma Sphinx>'s middle ability triggers, if <Enigma Sphinx> is removed from your graveyard in response, it won't be put into your library.
2009/05/01: If you have zero or one card left in your library when <Enigma Sphinx>'s middle ability resolves, <Enigma Sphinx> is put on the bottom of your library.
2009/05/01: If you control an <Enigma Sphinx> that's owned by another player, it's put into that player's graveyard from the battlefield, so <Enigma Sphinx>'s middle ability won't trigger.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.</Rulings>

2009/05/01: The triggered ability acts as a cycle-triggered ability or as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, as appropriate. The player who controls the triggered ability is the player who cycled the Sojourner, or the player who last controlled the Sojourner on the battlefield.
2009/05/01: If you cycle this card, the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2009/05/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2009/05/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>180607</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Playing a card this way works just like playing any other card, with one exception: You're playing the card from your opponent's hand rather than your own. To be specific: -- A card played this way follows the normal timing rules for its card type, as well as any other applicable restrictions such as "Cast [this card] only during combat." For example, you can't play a card from the targeted opponent's hand during your end step unless it's an instant or has flash. -- To cast a nonland card from your opponent's hand this way, you must pay its mana cost. -- You can play a land card from the targeted opponent's hand only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2009/05/01: You control the spells you cast from your opponent's hand, so you make decisions for them as appropriate. For example, if one of those spells says "target creature you control," you'll target one of your creatures, not one of your opponent's creatures.
2009/05/01: If you cast a spell with cascade this way, you'll control the cascade ability. When it resolves, you'll find a new card to cast from your own library.
2009/05/01: You can cast spells from the targeted player's hand, but you can't activate abilities. Specifically, you can't cycle cards in that player's hand.
2009/05/01: This ability doesn't prevent the targeted opponent's triggered abilities from triggering. If one does, that player puts it on the stack and, if applicable, chooses targets for it. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2009/05/01: If the resolution of a spell or ability involves having the targeted player cast a spell, that part of the effect simply won't work.
2009/05/01: After this ability resolves, the targeted player still gets priority at the appropriate times, and can still perform special actions (such as turning a face-down creature face up). However, since that player can't cast any spells or activate abilities — including mana abilities — there's not much they can actually accomplish this way.
2009/05/01: If you start to play a card from the targeted opponent's hand, there's no way for the opponent to get rid of that card in response (like discarding it to pay Gathan Raiders's morph cost, for example). That's because the first thing that happens when you start to cast a spell is that it moves to the stack, so it's not in your opponent's hand anymore.
2009/05/01: Once <Sen Triplets>'s ability resolves, it remains in effect for the rest of the turn whether or not you still control <Sen Triplets>.</Rulings>

2009/05/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2009/05/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: The triggered ability's control-change effect has no duration. Each Dragon you gain control of this way will remain under your control until the game ends, that permanent leaves the battlefield, or some other effect changes its controller.
2009/05/01: When the triggered ability resolves, you'll gain control of all Dragons, including the Dragons you already control (such as Karrthus itself). Usually this will have no appreciable effect, though it will override any previous control-change abilities (such as if you had gained control of one of those Dragons only for the rest of the turn). Then you'll untap all Dragons, including the ones you already controlled and Karrthus itself (if it had somehow managed to become tapped by then).</Rulings>

<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>147530</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: The source of combat damage is the creature that dealt it.
2009/05/01: If a spell causes damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Breath of Malfegor says "Breath of Malfegor deals 5 damage to each opponent."
2009/05/01: If an ability causes damage to be dealt, that ability will always identify the source of the damage. The ability itself is never the source. However, the source of the ability is often the source of the damage. For example, Deathbringer Thoctar's ability says "Deathbringer Thoctar deals 1 damage to any target."
2009/05/01: If the source of the damage is a permanent, <Retaliator Griffin> checks whether an opponent controls that permanent at the time that damage is dealt. If the permanent has left the battlefield by then, its last known information is used. If the source of the damage is a spell, whether it's controlled by an opponent is obvious. If the source of the damage is a card in some other zone (such as a cycled Jund Sojourners), <Retaliator Griffin> checks whether the card's owner, rather than its controller, is an opponent.
2009/05/01: If <Retaliator Griffin> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you're dealt damage by a source an opponent controls, <Retaliator Griffin> will be put into a graveyard before it would receive any counters. Its ability will still trigger, but it will do nothing when it resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>179540</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2009/05/01: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2009/05/01: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2009/05/01: You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.
2009/05/01: If you cast the last exiled card, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If that card has cascade, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
2009/05/01: After you're done exiling cards and casting the last one if you chose to do so, the remaining exiled cards are randomly placed on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player is allowed to know the order of those cards.
2009/05/01: <Maelstrom Nexus> affects the first spell you cast each turn, not just the first spell you cast on your own turn.
2009/05/01: If the first spell you cast in a turn already has cascade, both cascade abilities will trigger separately. Deal with them one at a time: First one cascade ability will resolve, and you'll cast the applicable card if you want. That new spell will resolve. Then the other cascade ability will resolve in the same way. Finally, the original spell will resolve.
2009/05/01: This effect takes into account spells that were cast earlier in the turn that <Maelstrom Nexus> entered the battlefield, including any spells still on the stack. If you've already cast any spells that turn (including <Maelstrom Nexus> itself), this ability won't give any of your spells cascade that turn.
2009/05/01: A spell's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. If its mana cost includes {X}, take the chosen value of X into account. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If cascade allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half but not both halves.</Rulings>
