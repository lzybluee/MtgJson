<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Watermark>Planeswalker</Watermark>
<Rulings>2018/10/05: If <Conclave Tribunal> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2018/10/05: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. When the card returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the card that was exiled.
2018/10/05: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: <Dawn of Hope>'s first ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Vicious Rumors or 3 life from Creeping Chill.
2018/10/05: You can't pay {2} multiple times to draw more than one card each time you resolve <Dawn of Hope>'s triggered ability.
2018/10/05: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Dawn of Hope>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2018/10/05: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and <Dawn of Hope>'s first ability triggers only once.
2018/10/05: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If another white creature you control is dealt lethal damage at the same time as <Light of the Legion>, they're destroyed at the same time. That creature won't receive a counter from <Light of the Legion>'s ability in time to save it.
2018/10/05: Mentor compares the power of the creature with mentor with that of the target creature at two different times: once as the triggered ability is put onto the stack, and once as the triggered ability resolves. If you wish to raise a creature's power so its mentor ability can target a bigger creature, the last chance you have to do so is during the beginning of combat step.
2018/10/05: If the target creature's power is no longer less than the attacking creature's power as the ability resolves, mentor doesn't add a +1/+1 counter. For example, if two 3/3 creatures with mentor attack and both mentor triggers target the same 2/2 creature, the first to resolve puts a +1/+1 counter on it and the second does nothing.
2018/10/05: If the creature with mentor leaves the battlefield with mentor on the stack, use its power as that creature last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the target creature has less power.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: Spells you've cast that were countered were still cast, and so will add copies when <Thousand-Year Storm>'s ability resolves for later spells in the turn.
2018/10/05: If an effect instructs you to cast multiple spells, they're cast one at a time in any order.
2018/10/05: <Thousand-Year Storm>'s ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2018/10/05: Copies are created even if the spell that caused <Thousand-Year Storm>'s ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copies resolve before the original spell.
2018/10/05: The copies will have the same targets as the spell they're copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2018/10/05: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copies will have the same value of X.
2018/10/05: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2018/10/05: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2018/10/05: The copies that <Thousand-Year Storm>'s ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as that of <Thousand-Year Storm> itself) won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: The owner of a token is the player who created it.
2018/10/05: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other creatures you control may become lethal if Trostani leaves the battlefield during that turn.
2018/10/05: If a creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of each end step and Trostani's ability causes you to gain control of it, the ability of that creature is still controlled by the creature's former controller. If the creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your end step, that ability doesn't trigger when you gain control of it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If an effect instructs you to draw multiple cards, each draw is performed—and replaced by <Underrealm Lich>'s ability—one at a time. This means that if you're drawing two cards, you'll look at the top three cards of your library, put one into your hand, put the other two into your graveyard, and then repeat the process with the next three cards in your library.
2018/10/05: <Underrealm Lich>'s first ability applies even if you have fewer than three cards in your library. If you have no cards in your library, you can't lose the game for trying to draw a card from an empty library.
2018/10/05: You can activate <Underrealm Lich>'s last ability even if it's already tapped. It can't be tapped again, but it still gains indestructible.</Rulings>
