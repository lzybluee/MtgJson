At the beginning of each of that player's upkeeps, if that card is exiled, remove a delay counter from it. If the card has no delay counters on it, the player puts it onto the stack as a copy of the original spell.</CardText>
<Artist>Steve Luke</Artist>
<Multiverseid>4698</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: Note that a delayed spell that targets another spell won't resolve when it resolves since it will find that its target is no longer on the stack.
2004/10/04: A targeted spell which is delayed will still succeed even if its target has phased out and back in again.
2004/10/04: <Ertai's Meddling> can't be cast through any way that doesn't pay its mana cost. This is because the X in the Meddling's mana cost can't be 0, but effects that allow spells to be cast without paying their mana costs set X to 0.
2004/10/04: If a copy of a spell (one that has no card representing it) is affected by <Ertai's Meddling>, the spell ceases to exist when exiled. It will not gain counters and will not be put back on the stack.
2004/10/04: Once it is put back on the stack, it is a "new" spell again and can be countered or even targeted by another <Ertai's Meddling>.
2004/10/04: If <Ertai's Meddling> is used to copy a spell being cast face down due to Morph ability, the spell will create a face up, 2/2, colorless, nameless creature with no text. This may be a little counter-intuitive, because you might expect the card to enter the battlefield face down like it would have when originally cast, but <Ertai's Meddling> copies only the original spell and not the entire card the spell represented.
2008/04/01: This now exiles the spell as part of <Ertai's Meddling>'s resolution, instead of waiting for the targeted spell to start resolving.
2011/01/22: If the spell was cast using flashback, <Ertai's Meddling> will still exile it with delay counters on it. When the card is returned to the stack, it still "remembers" the flashback cost was originally paid. It'll be exiled when it resolves or otherwise leaves the stack.
2013/04/15: If <Ertai's Meddling> is used to copy an arcane spell that had effects spliced onto it, it will create a spell with all of those effects. That spell's controller will not be able to splice additional effects onto the spell, since they did not re-cast the spell and instead simply put it back onto the stack.
2013/04/15: <Ertai's Meddling> has the spell's controller put the spell back onto the stack; it does not have its controller cast the spell again. Anything that triggers off of casting spells, such as Contemplation , won't trigger. Simillarly, effects that count spells that are cast (like Rule of Law) or prevent spells from being cast (like Iona, Shield of Emeria) won't count or affect the copy that is put onto the stack since the copy wasn't cast.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Spellbook (an artifact that says you have no maximum hand size) onto the battlefield and then put <Recycle> onto the battlefield, your maximum hand size will be two. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, you would have no maximum hand size.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If a spell or ability damages multiple things, divide up the damage before applying this effect. This means you can't normally end up with an odd amount of damage on something.
2004/10/04: The trample rules cause damage to be divided before it is doubled.
2004/10/04: If you have two of these on the battlefield, the damage is multiplied by 4.
2004/10/04: The multiplied damage counts in all ways as if it came from the original source. <Furnace of Rath> is not the source.
2005/08/01: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Suppose a spell would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. That player can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let <Furnace of Rath> double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/02/01: With a <Humility> and two Opalescences on the battlefield, if <Humility> has the latest timestamp, then all creatures are 1/1 with no abilities. If the timestamp order is Opalescence, <Humility>, Opalescence, the second Opalescence is 1/1, and the <Humility> and first Opalescence are 4/4. If <Humility> has the earliest timestamp, then everything is 4/4.
2007/02/01: Removes all creature abilities. This includes mana abilities. Animated lands will also lose the ability to tap for mana.
2009/10/01: This is the current interaction between <Humility> and Opalescence: The type-changing effect applies at layer 4, but the rest happens in the applicable layers. The rest of it will apply even if the permanent loses its ability before it's finished applying. So if Opalescence, <Humility>, and Worship are on the battlefield and Opalescence entered the battlefield before <Humility>, the following is true: Layer 4: <Humility> and Worship each become creatures that are still enchantments. (Opalescence). Layer 6: <Humility> and Worship each lose their abilities. (<Humility>) Layer 7b: <Humility> becomes 4/4 and Worship becomes 4/4. (Opalescence). <Humility> becomes 1/1 and Worship becomes 1/1 (<Humility>). But if <Humility> entered the battlefield before Opalescence, the following is true: Layer 4: <Humility> and Worship each become creatures that are still enchantments (Opalescence). Layer 6: <Humility> and Worship each lose their abilities (<Humility>). Layer 7b: <Humility> becomes 1/1 and Worship becomes 1/1 (<Humility>). <Humility> becomes 4/4 and Worship becomes 4/4 (Opalescence).
2009/10/01: You apply power/toughness changing effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (a) effects from characteristic-defining abilities; (b) effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (c) effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (d) changes from counters; (e) effects that switch a creature's power and toughness. This card's effect is always applied in (b), which means that effects applied in sublayer (c), (d), or (e) will not be overwritten; they will be applied to the new value.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Paying the cost to end the effect is a special action and can't be responded to.
2013/04/15: If a spell that can target enchantments but not creatures (such as Clear) is cast targeting the Licid after it has become an enchantment, but the Licid's controller pays the cost, the Licid will no longer be an enchantment. This will result in the spell failing to resolve for having no legal targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Any replacement effects are considered by <Reflecting Pool> when determining the types of mana a land can produce.
2004/10/04: Any change to a land's type or splicing of text into a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
2008/05/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag says "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you control Vivid Crag and <Reflecting Pool>, you can tap <Reflecting Pool> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do. It just cares about types of mana.
2008/05/01: Multiple <Reflecting Pool>s won't help each other produce mana. If you control a <Reflecting Pool>, and all other lands you control either lack mana abilities or are other <Reflecting Pool>s, you may still activate <Reflecting Pool>'s ability — it just won't produce any mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.</Rulings>
