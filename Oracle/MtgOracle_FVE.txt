<CardText>Each player chooses a number of lands they control equal to the number of lands controlled by the player who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players discard cards and sacrifice creatures the same way.</CardText>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: If a discarded card isn't put into your graveyard (due to an effect such as that of Obstinate Baloth) or leaves your graveyard (perhaps because another effect returned it to your hand), it won't be exiled.

2017/11/17: <Necropotence>'s last ability creates a delayed triggered ability that will put the exiled card into your hand. That ability still triggers even if <Necropotence> is removed from the battlefield before your end step.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>194979</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/12/01: <Trinisphere>'s ability affects the total cost of the spell. It is applied *after* any other cost increasers or cost reducers are applied: First apply any cost increases. Next apply any cost reducers. Finally look at the amount of mana you have to pay. If it's less than three mana, you'll pay three mana.
2004/12/01: Even with a cost reducer on the battlefield, spells can't cost less than three mana to cast.
2004/12/01: If a spell costs at least three mana due to additional costs, such as kicker costs, that's fine.
2004/12/01: You still need to pay any additional nonmana costs the spell has, such as sacrificing a creature or discarding cards.
2004/12/01: Casting a creature with morph face down already costs three mana, even though the converted mana cost of the face-down spell is zero, so <Trinisphere> normally doesn't modify the total cost of a face-down creature spell. However, if Dream Chisel is reducing that cost while <Trinisphere> is on the battlefield, you'll still have to pay three mana for the spell.</Rulings>
