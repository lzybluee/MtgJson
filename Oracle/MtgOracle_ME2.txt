When Angel of Fury dies, you may shuffle it into its owner's library.</CardText>
<Artist>Keith Parkinson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>184746</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If <Angel of Fury> is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has it move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.
2008/10/01: <Angel of Fury>'s second ability is a leaves-the-battlefield ability. Because it works only from on the battlefield, it behaves differently than the _Lorwyn_ Incarnations. When <Angel of Fury> is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it will look back in time (to the point just before it left the battlefield) to see if its ability triggers. That means the following: — If <Angel of Fury> lost its triggered ability while on the battlefield (due to Snakeform, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would not trigger. <Angel of Fury> would stay in its owner's graveyard. — If <Angel of Fury> had its triggered ability when it left the battlefield, but lost it when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability would still trigger. <Angel of Fury> would be shuffled into its owner's library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you put this on your opponent's creature, they decide whether or not to make their creature deal no damage to you.
2008/10/01: This ability resolves during the declare blockers step. If the damage dealt this way is enough to destroy an attacking or blocking creature, that other creature won't be around to deal its combat damage.
2008/10/01: If the same creature is enchanted with more than one <Farrel's Mantle>, they'll each trigger if that creature attacks and isn't blocked. The creature's controller may have it deal damage multiple times. As long as the enchanted creature's controller chooses to use <Farrel's Mantle>'s ability at least once to deal damage, the enchanted creature will deal no combat damage.
2008/10/01: If the enchanted creature's controller chooses to have it deal no combat damage, that combat damage is not prevented. It's simply not dealt. A creature whose damage can't be prevented (such as Excruciator) would deal no combat damage this way.
2011/01/25: The enchanted creature's controller cannot choose to have the enchanted creature deal damage to itself. If there are no other creatures on the battlefield, then a legal target cannot be chosen so the ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: An ability that triggers when something "attacks and isn't blocked" triggers in the declare blockers step after blockers are declared if (1) that creature is attacking and (2) no creatures are declared to block it.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: The second ability is not a prevention effect. It stops unpreventable damage from reducing your life total below 1.
2008/10/01: The ability doesn't change how much damage is dealt; it just changes how much life that damage makes you lose. An effect such as Spirit Link will see the full amount of damage being dealt.
2008/10/01: If an effect asks you to pay life, you can't pay more life than you have.
2008/10/01: The second ability applies only if your life total is being reduced by damage. Other effects or costs (such as "lose 1 life" or "pay 1 life") can reduce your life total below 1 as normal.
2008/10/01: Paying cumulative upkeep is always optional. If it's not paid, the permanent with cumulative upkeep is sacrificed. Partial payments of the total cumulative upkeep cost can't be made. For example, if a permanent with "cumulative upkeep {1}" has three age counters on it when its cumulative upkeep ability triggers, it gets another age counter and then its controller chooses to either pay {4} or sacrifice the permanent.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each triggers separately.

2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it.

If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first.

2008/04/01: This is a new wording. <Dance of the Dead> is now an Aura. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to that card again (since the card is treated as a new object on the battlefield).

2008/04/01: If the creature card put onto the battlefield has protection from black (or anything that prevents this from legally being attached), this won't be able to attach to it. Then this will go to the graveyard as a state-based action, causing the creature to be sacrificed.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: If a creature <Krovikan Vampire> dealt damage to dies, then leaves the graveyard by some means, the game loses track of it. <Krovikan Vampire>'s ability won't be able to return it to the battlefield, even if it's put back into the graveyard before the end step.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: A card is "directly above" another card in your graveyard if it was put into that graveyard later and there are no cards in between the two.
2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

Similarly, if the exiled card is a land, you can't play it if you've already played a land that turn. If it's a nonland card, you'll have to pay its mana cost.
