<Rulings>2019/05/03: The ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Ajani's Welcome or 2 life from Battlefield Promotion.
2019/05/03: If <Ajani's Pridemate> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2019/05/03: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Ajani's Pridemate>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/05/03: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers only once.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: During your turn, <Angelic Arbiter>'s abilities have no effect on the game.
2010/08/15: During an opponent's turn, that opponent may either cast spells or attack with creatures, but not both (assuming that <Angelic Arbiter> is on the battlefield for the entirety of that turn). The player may perform other actions, such as activating abilities and playing lands.
2010/08/15: If <Angelic Arbiter> leaves the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities cease to affect the game. For example, if an opponent casts Doom Blade to destroy <Angelic Arbiter>, that player may then attack with creatures.
2010/08/15: If <Angelic Arbiter> enters the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities take actions that player performed earlier in the turn into account, even though it wasn't on the battlefield at the time. For example, if an opponent casts a spell, then you use Leyline of Anticipation's ability to cast <Angelic Arbiter> as though it had flash, that player won't be able to attack with creatures that turn.
2010/08/15: <Angelic Arbiter>'s last ability applies if an opponent attacked with at least one creature during the current turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2010/08/15: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2010/08/15: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2010/08/15: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying
{X}: Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to you this turn. If damage is prevented this way, Vengeful Archon deals that much damage to target player or planeswalker.</CardText>
<Artist>Greg Staples</Artist>
<Multiverseid>208288</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: The only target of <Vengeful Archon>'s ability is the player it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you activate the ability, not at the time it prevents damage.
2010/08/15: If the targeted player is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the entire ability doesn't resolve. No damage will be prevented.
2010/08/15: <Vengeful Archon>'s ability doesn't have you choose a source of damage. It will apply to the next X damage you would be dealt that turn, regardless of where that damage comes from. It doesn't matter whether the damage would all be dealt at the same time. For example, if X is 4 and you'd be dealt 3 damage by Lightning Bolt, that 3 damage is prevented and <Vengeful Archon> deals 3 damage to the targeted player. The prevention effect will still apply to the next 1 damage you'd be dealt that turn.
2010/08/15: The effect of <Vengeful Archon>'s ability is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, <Vengeful Archon> (not the source of that damage) deals damage to the targeted player as part of that prevention effect. <Vengeful Archon> is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
2010/08/15: Whether the targeted player is still a legal target is no longer checked after <Vengeful Archon>'s ability resolves. For example, if a player targeted by <Vengeful Archon>'s ability puts Leyline of Sanctity (which says "You can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control") onto the battlefield after the ability resolves but before it prevents damage, the ability will still prevent damage and still deal damage to that player. If <Vengeful Archon> can't deal damage to the targeted player (because the player is no longer in the game in a multiplayer game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won't deal any damage itself.
2010/08/15: If <Vengeful Archon>'s ability doesn't prevent any damage (perhaps because a different prevention effect is applied to the damage that would be dealt to you, or because the damage is unpreventable), <Vengeful Archon> won't deal any damage itself.
2010/08/15: If <Vengeful Archon>'s ability prevents damage, <Vengeful Archon> deals its damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens before state-based actions are checked, and before any player can cast spells or activate abilities. If a spell or ability would have caused that damage to be dealt, this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.
2010/08/15: If you would be dealt combat damage by multiple attacking creatures, you choose which of that damage to prevent. For example, if X is 3 and you'd be dealt combat damage by a 1/3 Scroll Thief and a 3/5 Siege Mastodon, you might choose to prevent 1 damage from the Scroll Thief and 2 damage from the Siege Mastodon. You don't decide until the point at which the creatures would deal their damage.
2010/08/15: If the amount of damage that would be dealt to you is in excess of the amount of damage that <Vengeful Archon>'s ability would prevent, that source deals its excess damage to you at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then <Vengeful Archon> deals its damage.
2010/08/15: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, say you've activated <Vengeful Archon>'s ability with X = 3 targeting Player A, and you've activated <Vengeful Archon>'s ability with X = 1 targeting Player B. You're dealt 2 damage. You can apply the first prevention effect (dealing 2 damage to Player A), or you can apply the second prevention effect (dealing 1 damage to Player B) followed by the first prevention effect (dealing 1 damage to Player A). The unused portions of the prevention effects remain.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: After the ability resolves, the targeted creature attacks you only if it's able to do so as that turn's declare attackers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," it can't attack. If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2009/10/01: If the targeted creature would be able to attack either you or a planeswalker you control, it must attack you, not the planeswalker.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability during your opponent's turn after attackers have been declared will have no effect. The same is true if you activate the ability during your own turn.</Rulings>

2010/08/15: If the targeted spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), you can't choose a different mode.
2010/08/15: If you cast <Redirect> targeting a spell that targets a spell on the stack (like Cancel does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself. You can, however, change that spell's target to <Redirect>. If you do, that spell won't resolve when it tries to resolve because <Redirect> will have left the stack by then.
2010/08/15: <Redirect> can target any spell, not just an instant or sorcery spell. For example, you could use it to change the target of an Aura spell. However, if the targeted spell has no targets (for example, if it's an instant or sorcery spell that doesn't specifically use the word "target," or if it's a creature spell), <Redirect> won't have any effect on it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205041</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: Since <Captivating Vampire>'s activated ability doesn't have a tap symbol in its cost, you can tap a Vampire (including <Captivating Vampire> itself) that hasn't been under your control since your most recent turn began to pay the cost.
2010/08/15: The effect of <Captivating Vampire>'s activated ability has no duration. You retain control of the affected creature until the game ends, the creature leaves the battlefield, or a later effect causes someone else to gain control of it. It doesn't matter whether <Captivating Vampire> remains on the battlefield. Similarly, the affected creature remains a Vampire in addition to its other types until the game ends, the creature leaves the battlefield, or a later effect changes its types or subtypes.
2010/08/15: Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>205013</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/02/01: <Leyline of the Void> affects cards that would be put into opponents' graveyards from anywhere, not just from the battlefield.
2010/08/15: <Leyline of the Void>'s second ability prevents cards from ever reaching your opponents' graveyards. Abilities that would trigger when those cards are put into an opponent's graveyard (such as Hoarding Dragon's last ability) won't trigger.
2010/08/15: <Leyline of the Void>'s second ability doesn't affect token permanents that would be put into an opponent's graveyard from the battlefield. They'll be put into that graveyard as normal (causing any applicable triggered abilities to trigger), then they'll cease to exist.
2010/08/15: If your opponent discards a card while you control <Leyline of the Void>, abilities that function when that card is discarded (such as Liliana's Caress's ability, or a madness ability of the discarded card) still work, even though that card never reaches that player's graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of the discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.
2016/06/08: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans and "scryed" if applicable. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order.

<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Multiverseid>207104</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Necrotic Plague> grants the sacrifice ability to the creature it's enchanting. That means it triggers at the beginning of the upkeep of the creature's controller (not necessarily <Necrotic Plague>'s controller).
2010/08/15: <Necrotic Plague>'s last ability triggers when the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard for any reason, not just when it's sacrificed due to the ability it grants to that creature. It triggers if it and the creature it's enchanting are both put into the graveyard at the same time, or if the creature it's enchanting is put into the graveyard but <Necrotic Plague> isn't. (In the second case, <Necrotic Plague> is then put into the graveyard as a state-based action.)
2010/08/15: The player that controls <Necrotic Plague> at the time the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard is the player who controls the last ability (even though that creature's controller is the one who chooses its target). The first player returns <Necrotic Plague> to the battlefield under their control, regardless of whose graveyard it was put into. Note that the ability is mandatory; a target must be chosen if able, and <Necrotic Plague> must be returned to the battlefield if able.
2010/08/15: If no legal target can be chosen for <Necrotic Plague>'s last ability, it just remains in its owner's graveyard. Similarly, if the targeted creature becomes an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve and <Necrotic Plague> remains in its owner's graveyard.</Rulings>

<Artist>Michael Komarck</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205034</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s first ability doesn't target the artifact. No player may take actions between the time you choose an artifact and the time you put a phylactery counter on it.
2018/07/13: If you control no artifacts as <Phylactery Lich> enters the battlefield, its first ability won't do anything. As soon as it enters the battlefield, its last ability will trigger (unless you control some other permanent with a phylactery counter on it) and you'll have to sacrifice it.
2018/07/13: If <Phylactery Lich> and an artifact are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you can't put a phylactery counter on that artifact. You must choose an artifact you control that's already on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.
2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability checks your permanents for any phylactery counters, not just the specific one that it caused you to put on an artifact. For example, if you control two <Phylactery Lich>es and two different artifacts with phylactery counters, neither <Phylactery Lich> will be sacrificed if one of those artifacts leaves the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205007</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: For <Bloodcrazed Goblin> to be able to attack, an opponent must have been dealt damage that turn before the declare attackers step begins. The damage must have been noncombat damage of some sort, or it was combat damage and an additional combat phase has been created.
2010/08/15: It doesn't matter how an opponent was dealt damage, or even who controlled the source of the damage.
2010/08/15: If damage would have been dealt to an opponent but it was all prevented, redirected, or otherwise replaced, <Bloodcrazed Goblin> won't be able to attack.
2010/08/15: <Bloodcrazed Goblin>'s ability checks only whether damage was dealt to an opponent. It doesn't care whether that opponent also gained life. For example, if an opponent was dealt 4 damage and gained 6 life during the turn, that player will have a higher life total than they started the turn with — but Goblin Berserker will still be able to attack.
2010/08/15: If <Bloodcrazed Goblin> attacks, it doesn't have to attack the opponent who was dealt damage. It can attack a planeswalker. In a multiplayer game, it can attack a different opponent.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: Combat damage is the damage that's dealt automatically by attacking and blocking creatures, even if it's redirected (by Harm's Way, perhaps). Noncombat damage is any other damage (generally, it's damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability).
2010/08/15: The ability triggers just once for each event in which an opponent is dealt noncombat damage, regardless of how much damage that player is dealt. For example, if Lava Axe deals 5 damage to an opponent, <Chandra's Spitfire> gets just +3/+0.

2010/08/15: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Combust> would resolve, <Combust> won't resolve for having an illegal target.
2010/08/15: Spells that create prevention effects affecting the targeted creature can still be cast, and abilities that create prevention effects affecting the targeted creature can still be activated. However, damage prevention shields (including those created before <Combust> was cast) don't have any effect on the damage dealt by <Combust>. If such a prevention effect has an additional effect, the additional effect will still work (if possible).
2010/08/15: If a static ability would prevent damage from being dealt to the targeted creature, it fails to prevent the damage dealt by <Combust>. If that ability has an additional effect that doesn't depend on the amount of damage prevented, that additional effect will still work. It's applied just once as <Combust> resolves.
2010/08/15: Effects that replace or redirect damage without using the word "prevent" aren't affected by <Combust>; they'll work as normal.
2010/08/15: If a creature is dealt lethal damage by <Combust>, it can still regenerate. If it does, the damage marked on it will be removed from it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>204992</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Fire Servant>'s ability applies no matter who or what the damage would be dealt to: a creature, a player, or a planeswalker.
2010/08/15: If a red instant or sorcery spell you control causes damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Lightning Bolt says "Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target." Such a spell is affected by <Fire Servant>'s ability. If the source of the damage is something else (for example, if the spell is Soul's Fire, which says "Target creature you control on the battlefield deals damage equal to its power to any target"), it isn't affected by <Fire Servant>'s ability.
2010/08/15: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the permanent that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn" and Lava Axe is a red sorcery that says "Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker." Suppose a Lava Axe controlled by a player who controls <Fire Servant> would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let <Fire Servant>'s effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
2010/08/15: If a red instant or sorcery spell you control divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Fireball does), the damage is divided before <Fire Servant>'s effect doubles it.
2010/08/15: If you control more than one <Fire Servant>, the effects are cumulative. Two such effects will cause damage from red instant or sorcery spells you control to be multiplied by four; three such effects will cause damage from red instant or sorcery spells you control to be multiplied by eight.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: You can activate the ability repeatedly during a turn. This generally has no additional effect, unless some other effect (like that from Adarkar Windform has caused it to lose flying since the last time the ability resolved.
2010/08/15: For flying to work as an evasion ability, an attacking <Goblin Balloon Brigade>'s ability must be activated before the declare blockers step begins. Once <Goblin Balloon Brigade> has become blocked, giving it flying won't change that.</Rulings>

<Artist>Charles Urbach</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205018</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: If a cost includes life gain (like Invigorate's alternative cost does), that cost can't be paid.
2010/08/15: Effects that would replace gaining life with some other effect won't be able to do anything because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2010/08/15: Effects that replace an event with gaining life (like Words of Worship's effect does) will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2010/08/15: If an effect says to set a player's life total to a certain number, and that number is higher than the player's current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than the player's current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2010/08/15: Spells and abilities that would normally cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part simply has no effect.
2010/08/15: Static abilities that prevent damage (including protection abilities) don't do so. If they have additional effects that don't depend on the amount of damage prevented, those additional effects will still work. Such effects are applied only once per source of damage.
2010/08/15: Effects that replace or redirect damage without using the word "prevent" are not affected by <Leyline of Punishment>.
2010/08/15: If a creature is dealt lethal damage, it can still regenerate. If it does, the damage marked on it will be removed from it.
2010/08/15: Damage prevention shields don't have any effect. If a prevention effect has an additional effect, the additional effect will still work (if possible). Spells that create prevention effects can still be cast, and abilities that create prevention effects can still be activated.
2016/06/08: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans and "scryed" if applicable. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. Then the first turn begins.</Rulings>

<Artist>jD</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205038</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Reverberate> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2010/08/15: When <Reverberate> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2010/08/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2010/08/15: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Reverberate>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2010/08/15: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chippy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>204972</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: If a player reveals a nonland card, that player must cast that card if it's possible to do so, even if they don't want to. The player casts it as part of the resolution of <Wild Evocation>'s ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other play restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat").
2010/08/15: If a player reveals a nonland card, but can't cast it due to a lack of legal targets or a play restriction, it simply remains in their hand.
2010/08/15: If, as the result of <Wild Evocation>'s ability, a player casts a card "without paying its mana cost," any X in the mana cost will be 0, and that player can't pay any alternative costs (such as Demon of Death's Gate's alternative cost). On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), the player may pay those.
2010/08/15: If casting the revealed card involves paying a mandatory additional cost (such as the one Fling has), the player casting that card must pay that cost if able. If they can't, the card remains uncast in their hand. If the mandatory additional cost includes a mana payment, the situation is more complex. If the player has enough mana in their mana pool to pay the cost, that player must do so. If the player can't possibly pay the cost, the card remains uncast in their hand. However, if the player has the means to produce enough mana to pay the cost, then they have a choice: The player may cast the card, produce mana, and pay the cost. Or the player may choose to activate no mana abilities, thus making the card impossible to cast because the additional mana can't be paid.
2010/08/15: If a player casts a nonland card revealed with <Wild Evocation>'s ability, it's put on the stack as a spell, then <Wild Evocation>'s ability finishes resolving. The spell will then resolve as normal, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Autumn's Veil> itself may be countered by blue or black spells. Its effect doesn't apply until after it resolves.
2010/08/15: After <Autumn's Veil> resolves, any spell you control that turn can still be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Cancel), regardless of their color. If those spells are blue or black at the time they would resolve, they will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter the spell you control simply won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2010/08/15: If a creature you control is being targeted by a spell when <Autumn's Veil> resolves, nothing happens right away. When that spell would resolve, its color is checked. If it's blue or black, that creature will be an illegal target for that spell, and will be unable to be affected by it. If all that spell's targets have become illegal by the time it would resolve, it's countered.
2010/08/15: After <Autumn's Veil> resolves, no new blue or black spell may be cast that turn targeting a creature you control.
2010/08/15: Keep in mind that an Aura spell targets the permanent it will enchant (but an Aura on the battlefield doesn't target the permanent it's attached to).
2010/08/15: <Autumn's Veil> affects any spells and creatures you happen to control at any point during the rest of the turn, not just spells and creatures you control as it resolves. That's because it doesn't grant an ability to those spells or creatures; rather, it affects the game rules and states something that's now true about those spells and creatures.
2010/08/15: <Autumn's Veil> has no effect on abilities. After it resolves, spells you control may be countered by abilities from blue or black sources, and creatures you control may be targeted by abilities from blue or black sources.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If <Awakener Druid> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, nothing happens to the targeted Forest when that ability resolves. It won't become a creature.
2009/10/01: If the targeted Forest entered the battlefield this turn, it will be affected by "summoning sickness" once it becomes a Treefolk. You won't be able to attack with it or use its activated abilities that have {T} in the cost (including its mana ability).
2009/10/01: If <Awakener Druid> and the Treefolk are dealt lethal damage at the same time, both will be destroyed. However, if <Awakener Druid> leaves the battlefield before the Treefolk is dealt damage, it will immediately revert to being just a land and thus can't be dealt damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205084</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: Activating <Cudgel Troll>'s ability causes a "regeneration shield" to be created for it. The next time <Cudgel Troll> would be destroyed that turn, the regeneration shield is used up instead. This works only if <Cudgel Troll> is dealt lethal damage, dealt damage from a source with deathtouch, or affected by a spell or ability that says to "destroy" it. Other effects that cause <Cudgel Troll> to be put into the graveyard (such as reducing its toughness to 0 or sacrificing it) don't destroy it, so regeneration won't save it. If it hasn't been used, the regeneration shield goes away as the turn ends.
2010/08/15: To work, the regeneration shield must be created before <Cudgel Troll> is destroyed. This usually means activating its ability during the declare blockers step, or in response to a spell or ability that would destroy it.
2010/08/15: If <Cudgel Troll> is dealt lethal damage and is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch during the same combat damage step, a single regeneration shield will save it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Prized Unicorn> doesn't give a creature the ability to block it. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block it to do so. For example, it can't force a creature that's tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block to block it. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to block <Prized Unicorn> in that case either.
2009/10/01: If a creature the defending player controls can't block <Prized Unicorn>, it can block any attacking creature, or not block at all.
2009/10/01: If two <Prized Unicorn>s are attacking, each creature the defending player controls can block either one of them. (The defending player chooses.) A creature that can block multiple creatures, like Palace Guard, must block both of them.</Rulings>

<CardText>Protean Hydra enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.

<Artist>Jim Murray</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205112</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: All damage that would be dealt to <Protean Hydra> is prevented, even if it doesn't have that many +1/+1 counters on it. This is true even if <Protean Hydra> has no +1/+1 counters on it at all (and is able to remain on the battlefield because some other effect is boosting its toughness). If the amount of damage that would be dealt to <Protean Hydra> is greater than the number of +1/+1 counters on it, all the +1/+1 counters on <Protean Hydra> are removed from it.
2009/10/01: If unpreventable damage is dealt to <Protean Hydra>, the Hydra's second ability will try to prevent it and fail (meaning that damage has its normal results), and it will also remove that many +1/+1 counters from <Protean Hydra>.
2009/10/01: <Protean Hydra>'s last ability triggers whenever a +1/+1 counter is removed from it for any reason, not just when a +1/+1 counter is removed by its second ability.
2009/10/01: If multiple +1/+1 counters are removed from <Protean Hydra> at once, its last ability will trigger that many times.
2009/10/01: If a -1/-1 counter is put on <Protean Hydra> while it has +1/+1 counters on it, that -1/-1 counter and a +1/+1 counter will be removed from it as a state-based action. This will cause <Protean Hydra>'s last ability to trigger.
2009/10/01: If any +1/+1 counters are removed from <Protean Hydra> during the end step, its last ability will trigger and set up a delayed triggered ability that will trigger at the beginning of the next end step (which is near the end of the following turn).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat.
