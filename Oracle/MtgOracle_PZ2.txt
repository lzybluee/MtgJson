<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: The last ability of <Throne Warden> checks to see if you're the monarch as your end step begins. If you're not, the ability won't trigger at all. You won't be able to do anything that would make you the monarch during your end step in time to have that ability trigger. The ability will also check to see if you're the monarch as it tries to resolve. If you're not the monarch at that time, the ability will have no effect.
2016/08/23: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.
2016/08/23: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack, and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: While resolving <Orzhov Advokist>'s ability, you choose a creature you control or choose not to put any counters on a creature, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by players who chose before them. Then simultaneously each player who chose a creature puts two +1/+1 counters on the creature they chose.
2016/11/08: <Orzhov Advokist>'s ability doesn't target the creatures that receive +1/+1 counters. Their controllers choose them as the ability resolves. Players can't take actions between making their choices and the +1/+1 counters being placed.
2016/11/08: If a player chooses to accept <Orzhov Advokist>'s gift, that player can't attack you or a planeswalker you control with any creatures during their next turn, even creatures that weren't on the battlefield as <Orzhov Advokist>'s ability resolved.

<Rulings>2016/11/08: Cards that would be put into your graveyard are exiled even if you didn't play them this turn, such as a nontoken creature that would die.
2016/11/08: Creature tokens are put into your graveyard as normal (and cease to exist soon after). Abilities that trigger when a creature dies can trigger on token creatures being put into your graveyard but won't trigger on nontoken creatures being exiled instead of being put into your graveyard.
2016/11/08: You pay the costs for a card in your graveyard if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as emerge rather than the card's mana cost.
2016/11/08: You may play a land card from your graveyard only if you have an available land play.
2016/11/08: <Magus of the Will> doesn't change when you can play the cards in your graveyard. For example, if you have a creature card without flash in your graveyard, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2016/11/08: If another effect tries to change where a spell is put as it resolves, such as that of a rebound or buyback ability, you may choose whether to exile the card to <Magus of the Will>'s effect or to apply the other effect.</Rulings>

2016/08/23: If you don't cast the card, it will remain in exile.
2016/08/23: If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature that player controls that's been goaded is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack a player, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2016/08/23: If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player that goaded it.
2016/08/23: Being goaded isn't an ability the creature has. Once it's been goaded, it must attack as detailed above even if it loses all abilities.
2016/08/23: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of it before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.
2016/08/23: If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents that hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: You determine the size of the bonus as the melee ability resolves. Count each opponent that you attacked with one or more creatures. It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: Vial Smasher has to be on the battlefield at the moment you cast your first spell. If that spell causes Vial Smasher to leave the battlefield as an additional cost to cast it, Vial Smasher's ability can't trigger.

If no opponent is the monarch at that time, <Queen Marchesa>'s (long may she reign) ability will have no effect.
2016/08/23: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.

2016/11/08: An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands.

Partner (You can have two commanders if both have partner.)</CardText>
<Artist>Zezhou Chen</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: If your Commander deck has two commanders, you can only include cards whose own color identities are also found in your commanders' combined color identities. If Akiri and Silas Renn are your commanders, your deck may contain cards with white, blue, black, and red in their color identity, but not green.
2016/11/08: Both commanders start in the command zone, and the remaining 98 cards of your deck are shuffled to become your library.
2016/11/08: To have two commanders, both must have the partner ability as the game begins. Losing the ability during the game doesn't cause either to cease to be your commander.
2016/11/08: Once the game begins, your two commanders are tracked separately. If you cast one, you won't have to pay an additional {2} the first time you cast the other. A player loses the game after having been dealt 21 damage from one of them, not from both of them combined. Command Beacon's effect puts one into your hand from the command zone, not both.
2016/11/08: An effect that checks whether you control your commander is satisfied if you control one or both of your two commanders.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"I'm sure we can come to an arrangement."</Flavor>
<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: Your opponents can draw a maximum of one card each on each player's turn. Subsequent card draws during that turn are ignored.
2018/12/07: If an opponent hasn't drawn any cards in a turn and a spell or ability instructs that player to draw multiple cards, that player will just draw one card. However, if the draws are optional, the player can't choose to draw, even if they could draw one card this way.
2018/12/07: Leovold will "see" cards drawn by opponents earlier in the turn before it entered the battlefield, although Leovold can't affect cards drawn before it entered the battlefield. For example, if an opponent draws two cards, then Leovold enters the battlefield, that opponent can't draw more cards that turn, but the two drawn cards are unaffected.
2018/12/07: Replacement effects (such as that of dredge or Laboratory Maniac's ability) can't be used to replace draws that Leovold disallows. However, if an opponent's first draw is replaced (by a dredge ability, for example), that draw didn't happen and Leovold won't stop the next draw.
2018/12/07: If you and a permanent you control each become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls, Leovold's ability will trigger twice. The same is true if two permanents you control become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: As you proliferate, you can choose any players that have counters, including yourself.
2016/11/08: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them, such as suspended cards or a Lightning Storm on the stack.
2016/11/08: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter; you choose only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2016/11/08: If a player or permanent chosen this way has multiple kinds of counters, only a single new counter is given. You choose which kind of counter to give that permanent or player as you proliferate.
2016/11/08: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2016/11/08: If a creature has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, state-based actions remove the same number of each so that it has only one of those kinds of counters on it. There won't be any counters of the other kind to put onto it as you proliferate.</Rulings>

<Artist>Karl Kopinski</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: Spells you cast from your hand this turn will gain cascade even if Yidris leaves the battlefield.
2016/11/08: If Yidris's triggered ability resolves more than once in one turn, spells you cast from your hand will gain cascade that many times. Each instance of cascade triggers separately; resolve one cascade trigger and the spell you cast from it before resolving the next cascade trigger.
2016/11/08: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2016/11/08: When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
2016/11/08: If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
2016/11/08: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2016/11/08: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. Since it's cast from exile, Ydris's ability won't give the new spell cascade.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: The triggered ability triggers both when <Armory Automaton> enters the battlefield and whenever it attacks. You don't have to choose only one.
2016/11/08: You can choose to target no Equipment if you don't want to attach any to <Armory Automaton>. Because the ability is optional, you also don't have to attach the Equipment it targets as you resolve the ability. However, you must either attach all of the target Equipment or attach none of them.
2016/11/08: <Armory Automaton>'s ability can cause an Equipment one player controls to become attached to a creature another player controls. The controller of the Equipment can pay the equip cost to move that Equipment to a creature they control, but only any time that player could cast a sorcery. The controller of <Armory Automaton> can't pay the equip cost to move Equipment they don't control.
2016/11/08: If an Equipment an opponent controls is attached to a creature you control, any ability of that Equipment that says "you" refers to that opponent. However, if the Equipment says that the equipped creature has an ability, the word "you" in that ability refers to you, the controller of the creature.
2016/11/08: If <Armory Automaton> leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, nothing happens to any of the Equipment it targeted. If they were already attached to other creatures, they remain attached to those creatures.
2016/11/08: An ability of an Equipment that triggers "whenever equipped creature attacks" triggers only if the Equipment was attached to a creature at the moment that creature was declared as an attacker, and any references to "that creature" in the effect refer to the creature the Equipment was attached to when the ability triggered.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Colorless is not a color.
2016/11/08: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2016/11/08: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes <Crystalline Crawler> cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} to cast it and have it enter the battlefield with five +1/+1 counters.
2016/11/08: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: The colors of mana that <Prismatic Geoscope> can produce aren't related to the specific basic land types among lands you control. For example, if you control a Plains and an Island, you can activate <Prismatic Geoscope>'s ability to add {R}{G}.
2016/11/08: You can activate <Prismatic Geoscope>'s mana ability if you have no basic land types among lands you control, but it won't produce any mana.
2016/11/08: <Prismatic Geoscope> can't produce colorless mana.
2016/11/08: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look for the Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest subtypes among the lands you control. Count each subtype that appears one or more times toward the number of basic land types among lands you control. This number can't exceed five.
2016/11/08: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests are the same as one Forest.
2016/11/08: Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Caves of Koilos is neither a Plains nor a Swamp.
2016/11/08: Some nonbasic lands do have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control—they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, a Blood Crypt, and a Forest, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"There is no justice when some profit and others go without."</Flavor>
<Artist>Bram Sels</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect applies to an instruction to draw more than one card before any replacement effects apply to individual cards drawn. For example, if you have a card with dredge in your graveyard, you can't dredge it before the effect of Divination is modified by <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect.
2017/08/25: Once a replacement effect has been applied to an event, it can't be applied again to the resulting events. For example, once <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect has modified the effect of a player's Divination, Thought Reflection can double that player's resulting card draw without <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect applying again.
2017/08/25: To determine whether a player is instructed to draw multiple once or instructed multiple times to draw one card, count how many times the word "draw" is used. <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect watches for one "draw" that instructs a player to draw multiple cards (including instructions to "draw a card for each. . .").

{T}: Add one mana of any color in your commander's color identity. When that mana is spent to cast a creature spell that shares a creature type with your commander, scry 1.</CardText>
<Artist>Alayna Danner</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or an effect changes your commander's color.
2017/08/25: Your commander's creature types are checked immediately after you cast a creature spell spending mana from <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability. They aren't set before the game begins, and they may not be the same types your commander had when you activated that ability.
2017/08/25: If you cast your commander with mana from <Path of Ancestry>, and your commander hasn't somehow lost all of its creature types while on the stack, you'll scry 1.
2017/08/25: If mana from <Path of Ancestry> is spent to cast a creature spell that shares a type with your commander, you'll scry 1 before that spell resolves.
2017/08/25: If your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or is phased out, it's considered to have no creature types.
2017/08/25: If your commander has no creature types, it can't share a creature type with any spell that you cast.
2017/08/25: If <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability produces two mana (most likely due to Mana Reflection), you'll scry 1 twice if you spend those two mana to cast one creature spell that shares a type with your commander. You won't scry 2. You'll also scry 1 twice if you spend this mana to cast two creature spells that each share a type with your commander.
2017/08/25: On the other hand, if an ability triggers when you tap <Path of Ancestry> for mana and produces more mana (such as that of Zendikar Resurgent or Mirari's Wake), you'll scry 1 only once when you spend those two mana.
2017/08/25: If your commander is a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth that has no colors in its color identity, <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability produces no mana.
2017/08/25: In formats other than Commander, <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability produces no mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: Creatures that enter the battlefield after <Disrupt Decorum> resolves won't be goaded.

2017/08/25: If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2017/08/25: If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player who goaded it.
2017/08/25: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of that creature before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.
2017/08/25: If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.</Rulings>

Exile Teferi's Protection.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on the "protection from" keyword ----------
2017/08/25: If a player has protection from everything, it means three things: 1) All damage that would be dealt to that player is prevented. 2) Auras can't be attached to that player. 3) That player can't be the target of spells or abilities.
2017/08/25: Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. An effect that doesn't target you could still cause you to discard cards, for example. Creatures can still attack you while you have protection from everything, although combat damage that they would deal to you will be prevented.
2017/08/25: Gaining protection from everything causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets you. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on what it means if your life total can't change ----------
2017/08/25: Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve while your life total can't change, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
2017/08/25: Protection from everything will usually prevent damage if it would be dealt to you, but some damage can't be prevented. In this case, because your life total also can't change, that damage has any other effects that it may have aside from causing you to lose that much life (such as effects from lifelink or infect) and triggers and effects can see that damage was dealt even though your life total didn't change.
2017/08/25: You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life.
2017/08/25: If a cost includes causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
2017/08/25: Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other event won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life. The same is true for effects that would replace having you lose life with some other event.
2017/08/25: Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will apply and end up replacing the event with nothing.
2017/08/25: If an effect would set your life total to a certain number that's different than your current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything.
2017/08/25: If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.
2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on the phasing keyword ----------
2017/08/25: While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
2017/08/25: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2017/08/25: Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Banishing Light, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
2017/08/25: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Mathas, Fiend Seeker ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
2017/08/25: Each Aura and Equipment that phases out attached to a permanent that's phasing out phases in with that permanent and still attached to it.
2017/08/25: Each Aura and Equipment you control attached to a permanent that isn't phasing out phases in attached to that permanent if it can still be attached to that permanent. If not, it phases in unattached. An Aura that phases in unattached will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. The same is true with Auras attached to players.
2017/08/25: Permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
2017/08/25: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2017/08/25: If a token is phased out, it will phase in as your next untap step begins. This is a change from previous rules.
2017/08/25: A permanent phasing out causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets that permanent. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2017/08/25: If your untap step is somehow skipped as your next turn begins, your phased-out permanents won't phase in until the next untap step you actually have, but you'll no longer have protection from everything and your life total can change again.
2017/08/25: Any creatures that phase in under your control as your next untap step begins will be able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn.
2017/08/25: If you gain control of another player's permanent and it phases out, if the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under that other player's control as your next untap step begins. If you leave the game before your next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after your turn would have begun.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: If a permanent has protection from Rats, it means four things: 1) Damage from a source that's a Rat that would be dealt to that permanent is prevented. 2) Auras and Equipment that are somehow Rats can't be attached to that permanent. 3) Rats can't block that permanent. 4) That permanent can't be the target of abilities of Rats or spells that are somehow Rats.
2017/08/25: Nothing other than the specified events is prevented or illegal. <Hungry Lynx> can't block a Rat with the ability "This creature can't be blocked," for example.
2017/08/25: The opponent who creates the Rat token is the owner of that token.
2017/08/25: Tokens that are sacrificed or destroyed are put into their owner's graveyard before ceasing to exist. If the token was a Rat, <Hungry Lynx>'s last ability will trigger.
2017/08/25: <Hungry Lynx>'s last ability puts a +1/+1 counter on each Cat you control, including itself.
2017/08/25: If <Hungry Lynx> dies at the same time as a Rat, its ability triggers, but <Hungry Lynx> won't be on the battlefield as that ability resolves. It can't be saved by the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on it. The same is true of any other Cats you control that die at the same time. Your remaining Cats will each get a +1/+1 counter.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: The tokens copy exactly what was printed on the creatures and nothing else (unless one of those creatures was copying something else or was a token; see below).

2017/08/25: Licia's first ability checks how much life you've gained during the turn, not what your life total is compared to what it was when the turn began. For example, if you start the turn at 30 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 10 life later that turn, Licia still costs {6} less to cast.

2017/08/25: The token copies exactly what was printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature was copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.

2017/08/25: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2017/08/25: If the creature that caused Inalla's ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {1}. If you do, you'll create a token with the copiable values of the characteristics of that creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2017/08/25: If a copied creature is legendary, any triggered abilities it has will trigger if appropriate before the "legend rule" causes one of those legendary creatures to be put into its owner's graveyard. Those abilities will be put on the stack after the "legend rule" is applied.
2017/08/25: To activate Inalla's last ability, you may tap any untapped Wizards you control, including ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, such as Inalla itself. (Note that tapping the creature doesn't use {T} [the tap symbol].)

<Artist>Simon Dominic</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: If Taigam leaves the battlefield after it attacks, its last ability won't trigger whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand this turn. If it leaves the battlefield after the spell has gained rebound, that spell will still have rebound. Once the card is exiled, rebound's delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of your next upkeep even if you no longer control Taigam.
2017/08/25: If Taigam is killed in response to you casting a spell, the ability will still trigger and your spell will gain rebound if Taigam attacked.
2017/08/25: Casting the card again due to rebound's delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
2017/08/25: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (either because another spell or ability counters it or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.
2017/08/25: If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2017/08/25: If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Teferi's Protection, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply.
2017/08/25: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. A spell you cast this way resolves before you can cast the next one, so one rebounded spell can't target another. Timing permissions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2017/08/25: If you cast a card from exile, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: Ramos's triggered ability counts the number of colors a spell has (from zero to five), not how many colored mana symbols are there in its mana cost or how many colors of mana you spent.

2017/08/25: Ramos's triggered ability doesn't trigger until you've finished casting a spell, including paying all of its costs. If Ramos has fewer than five +1/+1 counters on it, there's no way to add counters with a spell and pay for that spell with the newly-added counters.
2017/08/25: Ramos's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve even if that spell is countered. If that spell is countered, use its last known information to determine what colors it was.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: Once the second ability of <Mirror of the Forebears> resolves, it no longer has that ability.
2017/08/25: <Mirror of the Forebears> copies the printed values of the target creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target creature become a creature.
2017/08/25: <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> copies a creature that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
2017/08/25: If you activate the second ability of <Mirror of the Forebears> multiple times in a turn in response to itself, then each time one of those abilities resolves, it will overwrite whatever <Mirror of the Forebears> is copying. <Mirror of the Forebears> will wind up as a copy of the permanent targeted by the last ability to resolve. When the turn ends, all instances of the ability will wear off at the same time.
2017/08/25: If an effect begins to apply to <Mirror of the Forebears> before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply. For example, if <Mirror of the Forebears> is activated twice in response to itself targeting first Spirit of the Hearth then Temur Sabertooth, the ability it has while it's a copy of Temur Sabertooth can be activated and its effect will continue to apply while <Mirror of the Forebears> is a copy of Spirit of the Hearth.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (if it gains any) unless it has haste.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes a copy of a legendary creature you control, you'll put one of them into your graveyard.
2017/08/25: If you somehow control a <Mirror of the Forebears> with no chosen creature type, its activated ability can't be activated.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes a copy of a creature that itself has an ability that asks you to choose a creature type as it enters the battlefield and another ability that references "the chosen creature type," that ability won't have a choice made for it. You won't use the type chosen for <Mirror of the Forebears>.
2017/08/25: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Cat. Card types such as "artifact" can't be chosen.
2017/08/25: You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Cat Warrior." A Cat Warrior is both a Cat and a Warrior. It's affected by anything that affects either type and unaffected by things that affect non-Cat or non-Warrior creatures.</Rulings>

<CardText>Council's dilemma — Starting with you, each player votes for time or money. For each time vote, take an extra turn after this one. For each money vote, choose a permanent owned by the voter and gain control of it. Exile Expropriate.</CardText>
<Flavor>Few things are more valuable than time or money—and Leovold has plenty of both.</Flavor>
<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: <Expropriate> doesn't target any of the permanents you gain control of. You could choose a permanent with hexproof, for example. (Hey, money talks.)
2016/08/23: You can vote money to gain control of a permanent you own, no matter who controls it.
2016/08/23: Unlike the will of the council cards from the original Conspiracy set, where a majority of votes determined what happened, each vote made for a council's dilemma card adds to the ultimate effect.
2016/08/23: The effects of each council's dilemma ability happen in the stated order. First the vote occurs, then the first effect, and finally the second effect.
2016/08/23: Because the votes are made in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
2016/08/23: You must vote for one of the available options. You can't abstain.
2016/08/23: If a creature with an enters-the-battlefield council's dilemma ability leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, players can still vote for any option that would put +1/+1 counters on that creature, even though—or perhaps especially because—those votes won't generate an effect.
2016/08/23: No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
2016/08/23: Players can't do anything between voting and finishing the resolution of the spell or ability that included the vote.</Rulings>

<CardText>Council's dilemma — Starting with you, each player votes for wild or free. Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a creature card for each wild vote. Put those creature cards onto the battlefield, then shuffle the rest into your library. You may put a permanent card from your hand onto the battlefield for each free vote.</CardText>
<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: The creature cards revealed for the wild votes all enter the battlefield at the same time, followed by the permanent cards put onto the battlefield from your hand for the free votes.
2016/08/23: Any abilities that trigger because of any of those cards entering the battlefield are put onto the stack at the same time, after <Selvala's Stampede> finishes resolving. You choose the order that abilities you control go on the stack, followed by each other player in turn order choosing the order for abilities they control. The last ability to be put on the stack will resolve first.

<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: The first ability of <Conqueror's Flail> constantly updates as the number of colors among permanents you control changes. If the number of colors decreases and the damage that was marked on the equipped creature earlier in the turn is now lethal damage, that creature is destroyed. Similarly, if its toughness becomes 0, that creature is put into its owner's graveyard.
2016/11/08: The five colors are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Conqueror's Flail> can't give a creature more than +5/+5. (Gold, artifact, and colorless aren't colors.)
2016/11/08: If you move <Conqueror's Flail> from one creature to another, there's no time in between that it's not attached to a creature. Assuming it's your turn, your opponents won't be able to cast spells.</Rulings>

<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>Wayne Reynolds</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You reveal all cards you intend to splice at the same time. Each individual card can be spliced only once onto any one spell.
2013/06/07: A card with a splice ability can't be spliced onto itself because the spell is on the stack (and not in your hand) when you reveal the cards you want to splice onto it.
2013/06/07: You choose all targets for the spell after revealing cards you want to splice, including any targets required by the text of any of those cards. You may choose a different target for each instance of the word "target" on the resulting spell.
2013/06/07: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen.
2013/06/07: <Desperate Ritual> isn't a mana ability. When cast, it (or the spell it's spliced onto) goes on the stack like any spell and can be responded to.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Warren Instigator>'s ability triggers when it deals any kind of damage to an opponent, not just combat damage.
2009/10/01: If <Warren Instigator> attacks an opponent and isn't blocked, its double strike ability will cause it to deal combat damage to that opponent twice, once during each combat damage step. Its triggered ability will thus trigger twice: <Warren Instigator> deals first-strike combat damage, its ability triggers and resolves, it deals regular combat damage, and its ability triggers and resolves again.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The target of the ability can't be a creature with Protection from Creatures, with Protection from Goblins, or with Protection from Red.

2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: Use your devotion to blue as the triggered ability resolves to determine how many tokens are put onto the battlefield. If <Master of Waves> is still on the battlefield at that time, its mana cost will count toward your devotion to blue.

2018/04/27: A spell causes you to gain life if its cost or effect instructs you to gain life or if an instruction in its cost or effect is modified by a replacement effect and the modified event includes you gaining life. If a spell's cost or effect instructs a source with lifelink you control to deal damage, that spell causes that life gain as well.
2018/04/27: If a white instant or sorcery spell you don't control causes you to gain life, <Firesong and Sunspeaker>'s last ability triggers.

<Flavor>The Law of Givesies Backsies is respected by every noble pursuer of shiny things.</Flavor>
<Artist>Alex Konstad</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: An artifact is "tapped for mana" when a player activates a mana ability of an artifact that includes {T} (the tap symbol). Notably, tapping an artifact to pay for a spell with the improvise keyword is not tapping that artifact for mana.
2018/07/13: If the artifact leaves the battlefield, <Treasure Nabber> doesn't nab it from the zone it moved to.
2018/07/13: The artifact remains tapped when you gain control of it.
2018/07/13: If an opponent taps an artifact for mana during your turn, you'll gain control of it and keep control of it until the end of your next turn.
2018/07/13: If you control multiple <Treasure Nabber>s, their effects all expire at the same time. You won't keep an artifact for any longer.
2018/07/13: If multiple players each control <Treasure Nabber>s, an artifact tapped for mana will make quite a journey. For example, if player A taps an artifact for mana during their turn, and players B and C are the next players in turn order who control <Treasure Nabber>s, C's ability resolves before B and C gains control of the artifact. Then B gains control of the artifact. B keeps it during their turn, and then C regains control of the artifact once B's effect expires, then A will have it back after C's expires. However, if B or C taps the artifact for mana, one of them will take it from the other. You may need to pay very careful attention to which effects are still in effect, which have expired, and who owns what.
2018/07/13: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If that player controls any nabbed treasures, the effect giving that player control of those artifacts ends.</Rulings>

2018/07/13: If another creature enters the battlefield as a copy of Gyrus, consider how much mana was spent to cast that creature to determine how many +1/+1 counters it enters with.

<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: A creature attacking a planeswalker you control won't cause <Coveted Jewel>'s last ability to trigger.
2018/07/13: <Coveted Jewel>'s last ability triggers after you declare blockers (or declare no blockers at all) if any attacking creatures are unblocked. It doesn't matter if some attacking creatures were blocked.
2018/07/13: <Coveted Jewel>'s last ability resolves after blockers are chosen but before combat damage is dealt.
2018/07/13: If more than one opponent attacks you at the same time, <Coveted Jewel>'s last ability triggers for each of them. You choose which player ends up with <Coveted Jewel>, but each of them draws three cards and has a chance to activate its mana ability.</Rulings>

<CardText>Improvise (Each artifact you tap after you're done activating mana abilities pays for {1}.)
Reveal the top X cards of your library. You may put any number of artifact cards with converted mana cost X or less from among them onto the battlefield. Then put all cards revealed this way that weren't put onto the battlefield into your graveyard.</CardText>
<Artist>Craig J Spearing</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Saheeli's Directive> considers the individual converted mana costs of the artifact cards you reveal. The sum of their converted mana costs may be greater than X.
2018/07/13: If a card in your library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/07/13: All of the artifacts put onto the battlefield this way enter at the same time. If any have triggered abilities that trigger on something else entering the battlefield, they'll see each other.
2018/07/13: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/07/13: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/07/13: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2018/07/13: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2018/07/13: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2018/07/13: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast <Saheeli's Directive> and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{R}{R}{R}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{R}{R}{R}.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: When <Magus of the Balance>'s ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses an appropriate number of lands they control (which may be zero if that player doesn't control more lands than the player who controls the fewest). Then each other player in turn order does the same, knowing choices made by previous players. Finally, all of the chosen lands are sacrificed simultaneously. Players repeat this process for cards in hand and creatures they control, except while choosing cards in hand, players won't know the identity of cards chosen by the previous players.
2018/07/13: Players can't take actions once <Magus of the Balance>'s ability begins to resolve until it's done resolving. If any abilities trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack after it's done resolving.
2018/07/13: If a player has zero cards in hand, controls no lands, or controls no creatures, other players will have to discard their entire hand, sacrifice all of their lands, or sacrifice all of their creatures, as appropriate.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: If you choose not to put the nonland permanent card you reveal onto the battlefield, you'll put it on the bottom of your library with the other cards.

2018/07/13: Each copy resolves one at a time. Any abilities that trigger on the permanent entering the battlefield resolve before the next copy resolves. The original spell is the last to resolve.
2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability counts only how many times you've cast your commander from the command zone before that triggered ability resolves. If you cast your commander again later, you won't get another copy.
2018/07/13: If your commander was countered, that time you cast it still counts.
2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability can copy the Storm spell even if that spell is countered before that ability resolves.
2018/07/13: The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as the Storm's ability itself) won't trigger.
2018/09/21: If you have multiple commanders (for example, because they have Partner), this spell counts the total number of times you have cast all of them this game. For more information, see https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1039255476276355073</Rulings>

Saheeli, the Gifted can be your commander.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Saheeli's second ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: The total cost to cast a spell is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if you control three artifacts, including one you can sacrifice to add {C}, Saheeli's second ability will reduce the cost of a spell you cast by {3}. Then you can sacrifice the artifact when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost, and it remains reduced by {3}.
2018/07/13: Saheeli's second ability reduces only generic mana in the cost of the next spell you cast.
2018/07/13: While resolving Saheeli's third ability, each token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact and nothing else (unless that artifact is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that artifact is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, or so on.
2018/07/13: If a copied artifact has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/07/13: If a copied artifact is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2018/07/13: If a copied artifact is copying something else (for example, if the copied artifact is a Sculpting Steel), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that artifact copied.
2018/07/13: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of a copied artifact will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this artifact] enters the battlefield" or "[this artifact] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the artifact will also work.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"My master believes anything is achievable."</Flavor>
<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.
2018/07/13: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at the beginning of" in their reminder text.
2018/07/13: Tawnos's ability targets an ability that is on the stack and creates another instance of that ability on the stack. It doesn't cause any object to gain an ability.
2018/07/13: An "artifact source" is a permanent, spell, or card in any zone with the card type "artifact." For example, Tawnos's ability can target a cycling ability you've activated if the discarded card is an artifact card.
2018/07/13: The source of the copy is the same as the source of the original ability.
2018/07/13: If the ability is modal (that is, if it says, "Choose one —" or similar), the mode is copied and can't be changed.
2018/07/13: If the ability divides damage or distributes counters among a number of targets (for example, the ability of Verdurous Gearhulk), the division and number of targets can't be changed. If you choose new targets, you must choose the same number of targets.
2018/07/13: If the activated ability's cost contains a choice, such as a creature to sacrifice or a number of counters to remove, the copy uses that same information. You can't pay the cost again, even if you want to.
2018/07/13: Any choices made when the ability resolves won't have been made yet when it's copied. Any such choices will be made separately when the copy resolves. If a triggered ability asks you to pay a cost (such as that of Mirrorworks), you pay that cost for the copy separately.
2018/07/13: If an ability is linked to a second ability, copies of that ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by the ability and the copy. For example, if Tidehollow Sculler's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied and two cards are exiled, they both return when Tidehollow Sculler leaves the battlefield.
2018/07/13: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Soul Foundry's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Soul Foundry's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create a token copy of each card.</Rulings>

For example, if there are three +1/+1 counters on <Bloodtracker> and it gets six -1/-1 counters, you'll draw three cards.

2018/07/13: If the copied artifact has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/07/13: If the copied artifact is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.

2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability counts only how many times you've cast your commander from the command zone before that triggered ability resolves. If you cast your commander again later, you won't get another copy.
2018/07/13: If your commander was countered, that time you cast it still counts.

2018/07/13: The phrase "you control" applies to both "enchanted creature" and "enchantment creature." That is, Kestia's ability triggers when an enchanted creature you control attacks, not any player's enchanted creature.
2018/07/13: Bestow is an alternative cost to cast the spell with bestow. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a bestow cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: A spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both. Similarly, a permanent with bestow is either a creature or an Aura, but not both.
2018/07/13: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow still resolves if its target is illegal. Instead of entering the battlefield as an Aura, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2018/07/13: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield or becomes an illegal creature for the Aura to enchant. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2018/07/13: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2018/07/13: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.</Rulings>

<CardText>Creature tokens you control have haste.
At the beginning of combat on your turn, create a 2/1 blue Myr artifact creature token. Then you may choose a token you control. If you do, each other token you control becomes a copy of that token.</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: The last effect of Brudiclad's triggered ability affects all tokens you control other than the chosen token, including the token that was just created if that isn't the chosen token.
2018/07/13: All other tokens you control become a copy of the chosen token, even those that aren't of the same type. For example, if you control a Treasure artifact token and choose the Myr token Brudiclad just created, your Treasure will become a copy of the Myr.
2018/07/13: The effect of Brudiclad's triggered ability lasts indefinitely. It continues to apply after Brudiclad leaves the game.
2018/07/13: Brudiclad copies only the values defined as the original token was created (unless that token is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that token is tapped or untapped, whether it as any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2018/07/13: If the chosen token is copying something else (for example, if the chosen token was previously affected by Brudiclad's triggered ability), then your tokens become copies of whatever the chosen token copied.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: The amount of life to lose is determined only as <Skull Storm> resolves. For example, if an opponent controls no creatures and has 30 life when you cast <Skull Storm> and make two copies, the first to resolve causes that opponent to lose 15 life (so they have 15 life left), the second causes that opponent to lose 8 life (7 life left), and the original spell causes that player to lose 4 life, leaving the player at 3 life.
2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability counts only how many times you've cast your commander from the command zone before that triggered ability resolves. If you cast your commander again later, you won't get another copy.
2018/07/13: If your commander was countered, that time you cast it still counts.
2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability can copy the Storm spell even if that spell is countered before that ability resolves.
2018/07/13: The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as the Storm's ability itself) won't trigger.
2018/09/21: If you have multiple commanders (for example, because they have Partner), this spell counts the total number of times you have cast all of them this game. For more information, see https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1039255476276355073</Rulings>

<Artist>Dimitar Marinski</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Arixmethes can't be played as a land.
2018/07/13: Arixmethes isn't a land until after it has entered the battlefield. Effects such as that of Blood Moon won't affect its enters-the-battlefield ability. Similarly, replacement effects that modify how creatures you control enter the battlefield will see Arixmethes entering as a creature rather than a land. However, triggered abilities (such as landfall abilities) will see that a land entered the battlefield and not a creature.
2018/07/13: Arixmethes can tap for mana the turn it enters the battlefield as long as it has slumber counters on it. If you can figure out how to untap it, that is.
2018/07/13: Arixmethes's effect causing it to be a land overwrites any earlier effects that gave it additional types. For example, a Phyrexian Metamorph that copies Arixmethes will be a land, not an artifact land, until its slumber counters are removed.
2018/07/13: Arixmethes's triggered ability resolves before the spell that causes it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/07/13: Once Arixmethes is a creature again, it can attack on the same turn as long as you've controlled it since your most recent turn began.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Winters</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Xantcha's first ability is a replacement effect that modifies how it enters the battlefield, not a triggered ability. Players can't take actions (such as activating its last ability) while Xantcha's on the battlefield before it's controlled by another player.
2018/07/13: If Xantcha can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2018/07/13: The player who draws a card when Xantcha's last ability resolves is the player who activated the ability.
2018/07/13: Xantcha's controller may activate its last ability. In this case, the same player loses 2 life and draws a card.
2018/07/13: If a player creates a token that's a copy of Xantcha, the player who creates the token is its owner, not the player under whose control it enters the battlefield. This is a change from previous rules.
2018/07/13: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If the player under whose control Xantcha entered the battlefield leaves the game, the effect changing control of Xantcha ends.</Rulings>

<Artist>Simon Dominic</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: The target permanent's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its types.
2018/07/13: <Reality Scramble> can target any permanent you own, including those another player controls. A token's owner is the player who created it.
2018/07/13: You'll stop as soon as you reveal a card that shares any card types with the target permanent. For example, if the target permanent is an artifact creature, you'll stop as soon as you reveal a card that's an artifact or a creature.
2018/07/13: In most cases, at least one card in your library (the card you put on the bottom of your library) will share a card type with the target permanent. However, in some unusual situations, no cards in your library share a card type with the permanent (perhaps because the permanent was a token or its types were changed). In that case, you'll reveal your entire library, put nothing onto the battlefield, and put the cards back in a random order.
2018/07/13: Casting a card by using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: You're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
2018/07/13: Casting a card with retrace from your graveyard follows the normal timing rules for its card type.
2018/07/13: When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again. If it's your turn, you may do so before any other player may take actions to try to remove it from your graveyard.</Rulings>

Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Octopus Umbra> overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply to a creature after <Octopus Umbra> becomes attached to it will overwrite this effect.
2018/07/13: Any power- or toughness-modifying effects (those that give +N/+N, for example) and counters will apply to the creature's new base power and toughness, even if they started to apply before <Octopus Umbra> became attached.
2018/07/13: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it (if it has any) and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2018/07/13: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Putrefy). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2018/07/13: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2018/07/13: If a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time (most likely because a creature with deathtouch has dealt damage to that creature greater than or equal to its toughness) totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2018/07/13: If a spell or ability (such as Akroma's Vengeance) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2018/07/13: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Putrefy does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2018/07/13: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability is what causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2018/07/13: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if the "legend rule" applies to it, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2018/07/13: If a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.</Rulings>

It may be cast at a time you normally wouldn't be able to cast a creature spell, but other restrictions (such as "Cast this card only from your graveyard") are enforced.

2018/07/13: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

2018/07/13: You'll still pay all costs for a spell cast this way, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs such as evoke costs.
2018/07/13: Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2018/07/13: If you somehow control a face-down token, you may exile it to activate <Primordial Mist>'s last ability, but you won't be able to cast that token.
2018/07/13: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2018/07/13: The face-down characteristics of a permanent are copiable values. If another object becomes a copy of a face-down creature or if a token is created that's a copy of a face-down creature, that new object is a 2/2 colorless face-up creature with no abilities.
2018/07/13: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2018/07/13: Because face-down creatures don't have a name, they can't have the same name as any other creature or share any creature types with any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2018/07/13: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2018/07/13: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2018/07/13: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2018/07/13: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2018/07/13: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2018/07/13: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using a morph ability, and so on).
2018/07/13: There are no cards in this set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2018/07/13: If an effect tries to return a face-down creature to the battlefield after it leaves (such as Aminatou's second ability or Adarkar Valkyrie's delayed triggered ability), that effect returns the card face up. If it tries to put an instant or sorcery card onto the battlefield this way, that card remains in its current zone instead.
2018/07/13: Some previous Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. Although a double-faced card can enter the battlefield face down, one already on the battlefield can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Artist>Filip Burburan</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Once a creature with power 3 or greater has blocked this creature, changing the power of the blocking creature won't cause this creature to become unblocked.
2018/07/13: A token creature can die just like a nontoken creature before ceasing to exist. <Ravenous Slime> can replace this by exiling the token.
2018/07/13: The exiled creature's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its power.
2018/07/13: If <Ravenous Slime> dies at the same time as an opponent's creatures, the opponent's creatures are exiled.
2018/07/13: If more than one replacement effect tries to change where a dying creature ends up, that creature's controller chooses which effect applies. For example, if two players control a <Ravenous Slime>, a creature controlled by a third player will be exiled by the <Ravenous Slime> of that third player's choice, and the other <Ravenous Slime> won't get +1/+1 counters.
2018/07/13: If an opponent's commander would die, that player may choose to save it and move it to the command zone before <Ravenous Slime> gets a taste of it, or that player may choose for <Ravenous Slime> to exile their commander and then save their commander from exile and move it to the command zone. <Ravenous Slime> receives +1/+1 counters only in the latter case.</Rulings>

<CardText>[+2]: Untap each enchanted permanent you control.
[-1]: Create a white Aura enchantment token named Mask attached to another target permanent. The token has enchant permanent and totem armor.
[-7]: Put the top seven cards of your library into your graveyard. Return all non-Aura enchantment cards from your graveyard to the battlefield, then do the same for Aura cards.
Estrid, the Masked can be your commander.</CardText>
<Artist>Johannes Voss</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: An enchanted permanent is one with an Aura attached to it. Enchantment permanents you control that don't have Auras attached to them aren't enchanted.
2018/07/13: If an Aura with totem armor is itself enchanted by another Aura with totem armor, destroying either the first Aura or the permanent it enchants will result in only the second Aura being destroyed instead.
2018/07/13: Estrid's second ability might target a permanent that can't have the Aura token attached to it. In this case, the token isn't created at all.
2018/07/13: Estrid's second ability can't target Estrid, but the Mask token may legally enchant Estrid if you find a way to move it onto her.
2018/07/13: All of the non-Aura enchantments put onto the battlefield with Estrid's third ability enter at the same time. If any have triggered abilities that trigger on something else entering the battlefield, they'll see each other.
2018/07/13: Aura cards returned with Estrid's third ability may enchant non-Aura enchantments put onto the battlefield with that ability.
2018/07/13: You choose what each returning Aura will enchant just before that Aura enters the battlefield. The chosen recipient must be able to legally be enchanted by the Aura. This doesn't target the player or permanent it will enchant, so an opponent's permanent with hexproof may be chosen this way.
2018/07/13: If an Aura card can't enchant anything, it remains in your graveyard.
2018/07/13: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it (if it has any) and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2018/07/13: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Putrefy). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2018/07/13: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2018/07/13: If a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time (most likely because a creature with deathtouch has dealt damage to that creature greater than or equal to its toughness) totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2018/07/13: If a spell or ability (such as Akroma's Vengeance) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2018/07/13: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Putrefy does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2018/07/13: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability is what causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2018/07/13: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if the "legend rule" applies to it, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2018/07/13: If a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.</Rulings>

Miracle {X}{B}{B} (You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it's the first card you drew this turn.)</CardText>
<Artist>Deruchenko Alexander</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.</Rulings>

<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: If you wish to put a land card onto the battlefield, you do so while <Aminatou's Augury> is resolving, before you're allowed to cast any of the other cards. You may do this even if you've already played a land this turn.
2018/07/13: If a nonland card has multiple types, such as an artifact creature, you may cast it as either of those types. For example, you could cast one artifact creature as your artifact card and another artifact creature as your creature card.
2018/07/13: If you exile a land with another card type, you can't play it later in the turn. You can only put it onto the battlefield at the time <Aminatou's Augury> instructs you to.
2018/07/13: You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of each spell you cast.
2018/07/13: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as evoke costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
2018/07/13: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

<Rulings>2018/07/13: If the revealed card doesn't have an odd converted mana cost or if that card does but you choose not to cast it, you draw a card. Keep in mind that revealing a card doesn't cause it to change zones. This means that the card you draw will be the card you revealed.
2018/07/13: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as evoke costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast it.

<CardText>When you cast this spell, copy it for each time you've cast your commander from the command zone this game. You may choose new targets for the copies.
Copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Fury Storm> can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2018/07/13: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. This means, for example, that <Fury Storm>'s copies may target <Fury Storm> itself, but this won't trigger the copy's "when you cast this spell" ability, and it won't increase the number of copies of other spells you end up with.
2018/07/13: If you copy a spell, you control the copy. It will resolve before the original spell does.
2018/07/13: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them, but not how many targets there are. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/07/13: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/07/13: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Lavalanche does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/07/13: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Chandra's Pyrohelix), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/07/13: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability counts only how many times you've cast your commander from the command zone before that triggered ability resolves. If you cast your commander again later, you won't get another copy.
2018/07/13: If your commander was countered, that time you cast it still counts.
2018/07/13: Each Storm's triggered ability can copy the Storm spell even if that spell is countered before that ability resolves.
2018/07/13: The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as the Storm's ability itself) won't trigger.
2018/09/21: If you have multiple commanders (for example, because they have Partner), this spell counts the total number of times you have cast all of them this game. For more information, see https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1039255476276355073</Rulings>

2018/07/13: Once <Estrid's Invocation> returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. You must choose an enchantment that's currently on the battlefield to copy (or to not copy anything). Auras that were attached to it will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any counters that were on it cease to exist.
2018/07/13: <Estrid's Invocation> copies exactly what was printed on the original enchantment (unless that enchantment is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that enchantment is tapped or untapped, whether it as any counters on it or any Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, or so on.
2018/07/13: If the copied enchantment has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/07/13: If the chosen enchantment is copying something else (for example, if the chosen enchantment is another <Estrid's Invocation>), then <Estrid's Invocation> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen enchantment copied.
2018/07/13: If the chosen enchantment is a token, <Estrid's Invocation> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Estrid's Invocation> doesn't become a token in this case.
2018/07/13: If the chosen enchantment is an Aura, you choose what it enchants just before <Estrid's Invocation> enters the battlefield. The chosen recipient must be able to legally be enchanted by the Aura <Estrid's Invocation> will be. This doesn't target the player or permanent it will enchant, so an opponent's permanent with hexproof may be chosen this way.
2018/07/13: If the chosen enchantment is an Aura but <Estrid's Invocation> won't be able to legally enchant anything, <Estrid's Invocation> remains in its current zone and doesn't enter the battlefield. If <Estrid's Invocation> is on the stack, it's put into its owner's graveyard.
2018/07/13: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied enchantment will trigger when <Estrid's Invocation> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this enchantment] enters the battlefield" or "[this enchantment] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen enchantment will also work.
2018/07/13: If <Estrid's Invocation> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another enchantment, it can't become a copy of that enchantment. You may choose only an enchantment that's already on the battlefield.</Rulings>
