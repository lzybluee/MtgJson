<Rulings>2016/06/08: Sacrificing a green creature is part of <Natural Order>'s cost. You can't sacrifice more creatures to search for more creature cards, and you can't cast <Natural Order> at all if you control no green creatures.
2016/06/08: Players can respond to this spell only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell or to make you sacrifice a different one.</Rulings>

<CardText>Trample
When Phyrexian Dreadnought enters the battlefield, sacrifice it unless you sacrifice any number of creatures with total power 12 or greater.</CardText>
<Artist>Pete Venters</Artist>
<Watermark>Dci</Watermark>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The sacrifices are simultaneous, not one at a time.
2004/10/04: Phasing in does not trigger "enters the battlefield" abilities, so you don't have to sacrifice again if it phases in.
2007/07/15: Reverted to its original wording, this now has an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability. During resolution of the triggered ability, you choose one option or the other.
2007/07/15: If the Dreadnought is no longer on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves, you may still choose either option.
2013/04/15: If you are unable to sacrifice 12 power worth of creatures, then you cannot choose that option; in that case, you must sacrifice <Phyrexian Dreadnought>.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The land put onto the battlefield does not count toward your one per turn limit because it was put onto the battlefield by an effect.
2004/10/04: Because the "search" requires you to find a card with certain characteristics, you don't have to find the card if you don't want to.</Rulings>

<CardText>At the beginning of your upkeep, if an opponent controls more lands than you, you may search your library for up to three basic land cards, reveal them, put them into your hand, then shuffle your library.</CardText>

<Rulings>2006/10/15: You can fetch any of the "Snow-Covered" lands, since they all also have the supertype basic.
2009/10/01: This ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless any one of your opponents controls more lands than you, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you control at least as many lands as each of your opponents by the time it resolves.
2009/10/01: You shuffle your library if you search, even if you don't put any basic land cards into your hand.</Rulings>
