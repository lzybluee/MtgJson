<Type>Legendary Creature — Shapeshifter 6/6</Type>
<ManaCost>7 (7)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
As Morophon, the Boundless enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.
Spells of the chosen type you cast cost {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} less to cast. This effect reduces only the amount of colored mana you pay.
Other creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1.</CardText>
<Artist>Victor Adame Minguez</Artist>
<Multiverseid>463950</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Sliver or Warrior. Card types such as artifact, and supertypes such as legendary or snow, can't be chosen.
2019/06/14: Morophon's effect reduces the total cost by up to one mana of each color. For example, if a spell of the chosen type costs {4}{R}{W}{W}, it will cost {4}{W} after applying Morophon's effect.
2019/06/14: If a spell has hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost, you choose which half you will be paying before determining the total cost. For example, if a spell of the chosen type costs {2}{W/U}{W/U}, you may choose for the cost to be {2}{W}{U} and then reduce it to {2}.
2019/06/14: Cost reduction effects are applied after other cost modifiers, so Morophon can reduce additional costs or alternative costs of spells of the chosen type.
2019/06/14: Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other creatures you control of the chosen type may become lethal if Morophon leaves the battlefield during that turn.</Rulings>

Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2019/06/14: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2019/06/14: Casting the card again due to rebound's delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn. If you do cast the card, it's put into its owner's graveyard as normal once it resolves.
2019/06/14: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered or doesn't resolve (most likely because its targets have become illegal), none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>463962</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Protection from a color means that the target creature can't be blocked by creatures of that color, can't be the target of spells of that color or abilities from sources of that color, can't be enchanted or equipped by Auras or Equipment of that color, and all damage that sources of that color would deal to it is prevented. Nothing other than these events is prevented or illegal.
2019/06/14: Similarly, protection from colorless means that the target creature can't be blocked by colorless creatures, can't be the target of colorless spells or abilities of colorless sources, can't be enchanted or equipped by colorless Auras or Equipment, and all damage that colorless sources would deal to it is prevented.
2019/06/14: A permanent gaining protection may cause a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve. None of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: The last ability of <Knight of Old Benalia> affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1.
2019/06/14: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it, and any other effects that could stop you from casting it to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that you couldn't pay for.
2019/06/14: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2019/06/14: After removing the last time counter, you must cast the card if able. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored. If an effect prohibits you from casting the card, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2019/06/14: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell).</Rulings>

2019/06/14: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<CardText>+2: Creatures you control with flying get +1/+1 until end of turn.
-3: Create a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying and vigilance.
-6: You get an emblem with "If you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead."</CardText>
<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Multiverseid>463975</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Serra's first ability affects only creatures you control with flying at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn or that gain flying later in the turn won't get +1/+1.
2019/06/14: Serra's emblem doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain life, even if that damage would reduce your life total to less than 1.
2019/06/14: Serra's emblem doesn't stop loss of life from effects that say that you lose life.
2019/06/14: If you have less than 1 life and somehow haven't lost the game, damage dealt to you reduces your life total further below 0 (as normal).
2019/06/14: In a Two-Headed Giant game, damage dealt to you and/or your teammate that would reduce your team's life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead, as long as you control a creature. It doesn't matter whether your teammate controls a creature, even if they're the player being dealt damage
2019/06/14: In the Commander variant, combat damage you're dealt by a commander is still tracked, even if it doesn't change your life total.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>463977</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Protection from a color means that the target creature can't be blocked by creatures of that color, can't be the target of spells of that color or abilities from sources of that color, can't be enchanted or equipped by Auras or Equipment of that color, and all damage that sources of that color would deal to it is prevented. Nothing other than these events is prevented or illegal.
2019/06/14: A permanent gaining protection may cause a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve. None of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2019/06/14: You can't choose "artifact" or "colorless" as <Shelter> asks you to choose a color, since those are not colors.
2019/06/14: The legality of a spell's targets is checked only as that spell begins to resolve. If <Shelter> gives the targeted creature protection from white, you'll still draw a card.</Rulings>

Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has vigilance.
When enchanted creature dies, manifest the top card of your library. (Put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)</CardText>
<Artist>Joe Slucher</Artist>
<Multiverseid>463979</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2019/06/14: The face-down characteristics of a permanent are copiable values. If another object becomes a copy of a face-down creature or if a token is created that's a copy of a face-down creature, that new object is a 2/2 colorless face-up creature with no abilities.
2019/06/14: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2019/06/14: Because face-down creatures don't have a name, they can't have the same name as any other creature or share any creature types with any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2019/06/14: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2019/06/14: A permanent that turns face up changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Turning a permanent face up doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent still target it, and Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent are still attached to it. If anything now targets or is attached to the creature illegally, the game rules will clean this up as appropriate.
2019/06/14: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2019/06/14: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2019/06/14: If an effect tries to return a face-down creature to the battlefield after it leaves (such as Astral Drift's delayed triggered ability), that effect returns the card face up. If it tries to put an instant or sorcery card onto the battlefield this way, that card remains in its current zone instead.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>463980</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: The abilities spliced onto the spell happen last, after all of that spell's other effects. Notably, the Golem won't be on the battlefield yet if the spell has an effect that affects all creatures, all creatures you control, or similar.
2019/06/14: You reveal all cards you intend to splice at the same time. Each individual card can be spliced only once onto any one spell, although multiple cards with the same name may be spliced onto one spell.
2019/06/14: If a spell is copied, choices made while casting it are copied, so the copy will have the same abilities spliced onto it as the original.
2019/06/14: If the spell is countered, any cards you spliced onto it remain in your hand.
2019/06/14: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen, including those from cards spliced onto it.
2019/06/14: The legality of a spell's targets is checked only as that spell begins to resolve. If the spell this card is spliced onto causes its targets to become illegal while it's resolving (for example, by removing them from the battlefield) you'll still create a Golem.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker or put onto the battlefield attacking during a turn's combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.

2019/06/14: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen, including those from cards spliced onto it.
2019/06/14: The legality of a spell's targets is checked only as that spell begins to resolve. If the spell this card is spliced onto causes its targets to become illegal while it's resolving (for example, by removing them from the battlefield), you'll still draw a card.</Rulings>

This means that the card you discard may be the fifteenth artifact card that causes the target player to lose the game, but it also means that if there is no legal target opponent, you won't draw or discard.

<Rulings>2019/06/14: The token will have <Mist-Syndicate Naga>'s ability. It will also be able to create copies of itself.
2019/06/14: The token won't copy counters, Auras, or Equipment on <Mist-Syndicate Naga>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a <Mist-Syndicate Naga>. But if any copy effects have affected <Mist-Syndicate Naga>, they're taken into account.
2019/06/14: If <Mist-Syndicate Naga> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the token will still enter the battlefield as a copy of <Mist-Syndicate Naga>, using <Mist-Syndicate Naga>'s copiable values from when it was last on the battlefield.
2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated only after blockers have been declared. Before then, attacking creatures are neither blocked nor unblocked.
2019/06/14: As you activate a ninjutsu ability, you reveal the Ninja card in your hand and return the attacking creature. The Ninja isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. If it leaves your hand before then, it won't enter the battlefield at all.
2019/06/14: The creature with ninjutsu enters the battlefield attacking the same player or planeswalker that the returned creature was attacking. This is a rule specific to ninjutsu; in other cases, when a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, that creature's controller chooses which player or planeswalker it's attacking.
2019/06/14: Although the Ninja is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated during the declare blockers step, combat damage step, or end of combat step. If you wait until after the declare blockers step, because all combat damage is dealt at once, the Ninja won't normally deal combat damage.
2019/06/14: If a creature in combat has first strike or double strike, you can activate the ninjutsu ability during the first-strike combat damage step. The Ninja will deal combat damage during the regular combat damage step, even if it has first strike.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: Effects that switch a creature's power and toughness apply after all other effects, regardless of when those effects began to apply. For instance, if you cast <Twisted Reflection> choosing its second mode and targeting a 1/2 creature, then give it +2/+0 later in the turn, it's a 2/3 creature, not a 4/1 creature.
2019/06/14: If <Twisted Reflection> is entwined, its two modes may each target the same creature, or they may target two different creatures.
2019/06/14: <Twisted Reflection> is always a blue spell. It's not also black if you paid its entwine cost.</Rulings>

<Artist>Grzegorz Rutkowski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464024</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Urza's last ability doesn't change when you can play the exiled card. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2019/06/14: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2019/06/14: The token created by Urza's first ability will count itself, so it'll be at least 1/1.
2019/06/14: You can tap any untapped artifact you control, including an artifact creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, to pay the cost of Urza's mana ability. Tapping an Equipment this way won't affect its abilities or the equipped creature.
2019/06/14: If you don't play the card exiled with Urza's last ability, it remains in exile.
2019/06/14: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs (such as that of Lesser Masticore), you must pay those to cast the card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated only after blockers have been declared. Before then, attacking creatures are neither blocked nor unblocked.
2019/06/14: As you activate a ninjutsu ability, you reveal the Ninja card in your hand and return the attacking creature. The Ninja isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. If it leaves your hand before then, it won't enter the battlefield at all.
2019/06/14: The creature with ninjutsu enters the battlefield attacking the same player or planeswalker that the returned creature was attacking. This is a rule specific to ninjutsu; in other cases, when a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, that creature's controller chooses which player or planeswalker it's attacking.
2019/06/14: Although the Ninja is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated during the declare blockers step, combat damage step, or end of combat step. If you wait until after the declare blockers step, because all combat damage is dealt at once, the Ninja won't normally deal combat damage.
2019/06/14: If a creature in combat has first strike or double strike, you can activate the ninjutsu ability during the first-strike combat damage step. The Ninja will deal combat damage during the regular combat damage step, even if it has first strike.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Dregscape Sliver> grants the unearth ability to other Sliver cards only while it's on the battlefield.

Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Cancel) will not.
2019/06/14: If a creature returned to the battlefield by the unearth ability would leave it for any reason, it's exiled instead—unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it. In that case, the spell or ability succeeds at exiling the creature. If the spell or ability later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Astral Drift might, for example), the creature card will return as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Livia Prima</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464038</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Multiple instances of menace or deathtouch on the same creature are redundant.
2019/06/14: If a creature has multiple instances of undying, they'll each trigger separately, but once one of those abilities returns the card to the battlefield, any others will have no effect. The creature won't receive multiple +1/+1 counters.
2019/06/14: If a card leaves the graveyard after it dies but before the undying trigger resolves, it won't be returned to the battlefield.
2019/06/14: Once undying returns the creature, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras that were attached to it won't return to the battlefield. Equipment that was attached to it will remain unattached. Any counters that were on it won't be put on the new creature.
2019/06/14: If a creature has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, state-based actions remove the same number of each so that it has only one kind of those counters on it. <Endling>'s undying ability can bring it back again if its +1/+1 counters are removed this way.
2019/06/14: If a creature with undying that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, undying won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because undying checks the creature as it last existed on the battlefield, and it still had +1/+1 counters on it at that point.
2019/06/14: If <Endling>'s power is reduced to 0 or less while in combat and it gains deathtouch, it won't deal damage, so deathtouch won't apply.
2019/06/14: If you activate <Endling>'s last ability, you don't choose whether <Endling> gets +1/-1 or -1/+1 until that ability resolves.
2019/06/14: If <Endling>'s last ability gives it -1/+1 enough times, it may have negative power. Use that negative value if its power is further modified. For example, if <Endling>'s last ability gives it -1/+1 five times, it's -2/8. Giving it +1/-1 twice after that makes it 0/6, not 2/6.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2019/06/14: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2019/06/14: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.
2019/06/14: Because devour applies as <Feaster of Fools> enters the battlefield, it can't devour creatures that enter the battlefield at the same time as it. It can devour creatures that convoked it, and those creatures can reflect upon the wisdom of convoking a demon.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: When comparing the characteristics of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2019/06/14: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither characteristic of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2019/06/14: If evolve triggers, the comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither characteristic of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve resolves, use its last known power and toughness to determine whether the creature with evolve gets a +1/+1 counter.
2019/06/14: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 0/3 creature with evolve and two 1/1 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2019/06/14: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2019/06/14: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated only after blockers have been declared. Before then, attacking creatures are neither blocked nor unblocked.
2019/06/14: As you activate a ninjutsu ability, you reveal the Ninja card in your hand and return the attacking creature. The Ninja isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. If it leaves your hand before then, it won't enter the battlefield at all.
2019/06/14: The creature with ninjutsu enters the battlefield attacking the same player or planeswalker that the returned creature was attacking. This is a rule specific to ninjutsu; in other cases, when a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, that creature's controller chooses which player or planeswalker it's attacking.
2019/06/14: Although the Ninja is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated during the declare blockers step, combat damage step, or end of combat step. If you wait until after the declare blockers step, because all combat damage is dealt at once, the Ninja won't normally deal combat damage.
2019/06/14: If a creature in combat has first strike or double strike, you can activate the ninjutsu ability during the first-strike combat damage step. The Ninja will deal combat damage during the regular combat damage step, even if it has first strike.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: If a card with persist is removed from the graveyard after it dies but before the ability trigger resolves, it won't be returned to the battlefield.
2019/06/14: Once persist returns the creature, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras that were attached to it won't return to the battlefield. Equipment that was attached to it will remain unattached. Any counters that were on it won't be put on the new creature.
2019/06/14: If a creature has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, state-based actions remove the same number of each so that it has only one kind of those counters on it. <Putrid Goblin>'s persist ability can bring it back again if its -1/-1 counters are removed this way.
2019/06/14: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature as it last existed on the battlefield, and it still had -1/-1 counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Winters</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464065</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Protection from Humans means that Yawgmoth can't be blocked by Human creatures, can't be the target of Human spells or abilities from Human sources, and all damage that Humans would deal to it is prevented. It also means that Yawgmoth can't be enchanted or equipped by an Aura or Equipment that is somehow a Human, although this can only occur with certain combinations of older cards.
2019/06/14: Protection from Humans refers only to the creature type Human. As far as Yawgmoth is concerned, you and your opponents aren't Humans.
2019/06/14: You may activate Yawgmoth's first activated ability without choosing a target creature. You'll just draw a card. However, if you choose a target and it becomes illegal before the ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve and you won't draw a card.
2019/06/14: The Modern Horizons set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters to proliferate, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/06/14: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them (such as suspended cards).
2019/06/14: Because proliferate doesn't target, you can proliferate counters on Yawgmoth with its own ability if it gets a counter.
2019/06/14: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to give another counter. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/06/14: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Bogardan Dragonheart>'s ability overwrites all previous effects that set its creature types, power, and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set these characteristics to specific values that start to apply after the ability resolves will overwrite that part of this effect.
2019/06/14: Effects that modify <Bogardan Dragonheart>'s power or toughness (such as the effects of Force of Virtue or Giant Growth) will apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters).
2019/06/14: <Bogardan Dragonheart> doesn't lose any abilities when it becomes a Dragon.</Rulings>

2019/06/14: Damage dealt by the Sliver due to its triggered ability isn't combat damage, even if it was combat damage that caused that ability to trigger.
2019/06/14: If a Sliver is dealt damage by multiple sources at once (such as by two creatures blocking it), its ability triggers once and one target is dealt that much damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Throes of Chaos> does nothing as it resolves. All of its chaos happens before it resolves.
2019/06/14: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before the spell. It resolves even if the spell is countered. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
2019/06/14: You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2019/06/14: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you cast it as a spell. It can be countered, and any abilities that look for spells cast (such as cascade, if that spell has cascade) can see it.
2019/06/14: When a spell you cast with retrace resolves or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Crashing Footfalls> has no mana cost. You can't cast it unless an effect (such as that of suspend) allows you to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost. Its converted mana cost is 0.
2019/06/14: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it, and any other effects that could stop you from casting it to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2019/06/14: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2019/06/14: After removing the last time counter, you must cast the card if able. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored. If an effect prohibits you from casting the card, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Scale Up> overwrites all previous effects that set the affected creatures' color, creature types, power, and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set these characteristics to specific values that start to apply after <Scale Up> resolves will overwrite that part of the effect.
2019/06/14: Effects that modify the affected creatures' power or toughness (such as the effects of Force of Virtue or Giant Growth) will apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creatures' power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters).
2019/06/14: The affected creatures don't lose any abilities when they become Wurms.
2019/06/14: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2019/06/14: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with protection from the appropriate color.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +0/+2 and assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.
Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464134</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Treefolk Umbra>'s effect doesn't actually change the enchanted creature's power. It changes only the amount of combat damage the creature assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values. For example, Savage Swipe won't cause the enchanted creature to fight with its toughness.
2019/06/14: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted creature would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it (if it has any) and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2019/06/14: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted creature would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because an effect is trying to destroy it (such as Mob). In either case, all damage is removed from the creature and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2019/06/14: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if the "legend rule" applies to it, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2019/06/14: If a creature has indestructible and is enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2019/06/14: If a creature you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted creature would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead—but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted creature.
2019/06/14: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time (most likely because a creature with deathtouch has dealt damage to that creature greater than or equal to its toughness), totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2019/06/14: If a spell or ability (such as Force of Vigor) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the creature it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted creature from being destroyed. The spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2019/06/14: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted creature does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted creature can't be regenerated (as Pillage does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.</Rulings>

If you do cast the card, it's put into its owner's graveyard as normal once it resolves.
2019/06/14: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered for any reason, that spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Tomasz Jedruszek</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464138</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Spells with additional costs that include {X} won't be affected by <Unbound Flourishing>. {X} must be in the spell's mana cost.
2019/06/14: An ability with a cost that includes X, but not the mana symbol {X}, won't be copied.
2019/06/14: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have a colon in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") that ask a player to pay {X} aren't copied.
2019/06/14: If the value chosen for X is 0, <Unbound Flourishing> will double the value to 0 for permanent spells, and copy other spells and abilities.
2019/06/14: <Unbound Flourishing> raises the value of X for permanent spells, but you don't pay any more mana.
2019/06/14: If a permanent has an ability that triggers when it's cast and that references the value of X, you choose whether to double the value of X before or after that ability resolves.
2019/06/14: If you control two <Unbound Flourishing>s, the value of X for permanent spells will be multiplied by four. If you control three, it will be multiplied by eight, and so on. On the other hand, spells and abilities that include {X} will only be copied twice if you control two <Unbound Flourishing>s, three times if you control three, and so on.
2019/06/14: <Unbound Flourishing>'s ability will copy any instant spell, sorcery spell, or activated ability whose mana cost or activation cost contains {X}, not just one with targets.
2019/06/14: A copy is created even if the spell or ability that caused <Unbound Flourishing>'s ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2019/06/14: The copy will have the same targets as the spell or ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
2019/06/14: If the spell or ability that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2019/06/14: The copy has the same value of X.
2019/06/14: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for a copied spell. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2019/06/14: The copy that <Unbound Flourishing>'s ability creates is created on the stack, so it's not "cast" or "activated." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activates an ability won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2019/06/14: Any cards you don't cast will remain in exile.
2019/06/14: <Fallen Shinobi>'s triggered ability doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if a sorcery card is exiled, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If a land card is exiled, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated only after blockers have been declared. Before then, attacking creatures are neither blocked nor unblocked.
2019/06/14: As you activate a ninjutsu ability, you reveal the Ninja card in your hand and return the attacking creature. The Ninja isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. If it leaves your hand before then, it won't enter the battlefield at all.
2019/06/14: The creature with ninjutsu enters the battlefield attacking the same player or planeswalker that the returned creature was attacking. This is a rule specific to ninjutsu; in other cases, when a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, that creature's controller chooses which player or planeswalker it's attacking.
2019/06/14: Although the Ninja is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2019/06/14: The ninjutsu ability can be activated during the declare blockers step, combat damage step, or end of combat step. If you wait until after the declare blockers step, because all combat damage is dealt at once, the Ninja won't normally deal combat damage.
2019/06/14: If a creature in combat has first strike or double strike, you can activate the ninjutsu ability during the first-strike combat damage step. The Ninja will deal combat damage during the regular combat damage step, even if it has first strike.</Rulings>

<CardText>Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.)
Sliver spells you cast have cascade.</CardText>
<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464149</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: <The First Sliver>'s last ability only applies while it's on the battlefield. If <The First Sliver>'s own cascade ability lets you cast another Sliver card, that Sliver won't have cascade.
2019/06/14: The cascade ability triggers when you cast the spell, meaning it resolves before the spell. It resolves even if the spell is countered. If you cast the card exiled by the cascade ability, that spell will go on the stack above the spell with cascade. You exile the cards face up. All players will be able to see them.
2019/06/14: You don't have to cast the last card exiled by a cascade ability. If you choose to do so, you cast it as a spell. It can be countered, and any abilities that look for spells cast (such as cascade, if that spell has cascade) can see it.
2019/06/14: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2019/06/14: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs (such as that of Lesser Masticore), you must pay those to cast the card.
2019/06/14: If a spell has multiple instances of cascade (for example, if you cast a second <The First Sliver>), each instance of cascade triggers and resolves separately. The spell you cast due to the first cascade ability will go on the stack on top of the second cascade ability. That spell will resolve before you exile cards for the second cascade ability.</Rulings>

Persist (When this creature dies, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a -1/-1 counter on it.)</CardText>
<Artist>Wisnu Tan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464174</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: You must discard exactly one card to cast <Lesser Masticore>; you can't cast it without discarding a card, and you can't discard additional cards. If <Lesser Masticore> enters the battlefield without being cast (perhaps because of its persist ability) you don't discard a card.
2019/06/14: If a card with persist is removed from the graveyard after it dies but before the ability trigger resolves, it won't be returned to the battlefield.
2019/06/14: Once persist returns the creature, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras that were attached to it won't return to the battlefield. Equipment that was attached to it will remain unattached. Any counters that were on it won't be put on the new creature.
2019/06/14: If a creature has +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on it, state-based actions remove the same number of each so that it has only one kind of those of counters on it. <Lesser Masticore>'s persist ability can bring it back again if its -1/-1 counters are removed this way.
2019/06/14: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature as it last existed on the battlefield, and it still had -1/-1 counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

{T}: Add one mana of any color.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464175</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: <Mox Tantalite> has no mana cost. You can't cast it unless an effect (such as that of suspend) allows you to cast it for an alternative cost or without paying its mana cost. Its converted mana cost is 0.
2019/06/14: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it, and any other effects that could stop you from casting it to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2019/06/14: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2019/06/14: After removing the last time counter, you must cast the card if able. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored. If an effect prohibits you from casting the card, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: If a creature with modular receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, modular will put a number of +1/+1 counters on the target artifact creature equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on this creature before it left the battlefield. That's because modular checks the creature as it last existed on the battlefield, and it still had +1/+1 counters on it at that point.

<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>464178</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/06/14: Protection from a color means that the equipped creature can't be blocked by creatures of that color, can't be the target of spells of that color or abilities from sources of that color, can't be enchanted or equipped by Auras or Equipment of that color, and all damage that sources of that color would deal to it is prevented. Nothing other than these events is prevented or illegal.
2019/06/14: The Modern Horizons set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters to proliferate, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/06/14: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them (such as suspended cards).
2019/06/14: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to give another counter. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/06/14: You choose a creature, put a +1/+1 counter on it, then proliferate all while the triggered ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between these things, and no player may choose to take actions.
2019/06/14: If a permanent or player you choose while proliferating has more than one kind of counter on it, it will get one more of each of those kinds. This means that if you put a +1/+1 counter on a creature you control with a -1/-1 counter on it, then choose that creature while proliferating, you'll put another of each of those counters on it before state-based actions remove them.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: In Limited events, you can't add basic snow lands to your deck from outside your card pool. You may add only lands named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest, as normal.

<Rulings>2013/06/07: The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.
2013/06/07: Spells cast from zones other than a player's hand and spells that were countered are counted by the storm ability.
2013/06/07: A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
2013/06/07: The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.
2013/06/07: You may choose new targets for any of the copies. You can choose differently for each copy.</Rulings>
