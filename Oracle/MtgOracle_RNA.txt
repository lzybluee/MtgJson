When Angel of Grace enters the battlefield, until end of turn, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.
{4}{W}{W}, Exile Angel of Grace from your graveyard: Your life total becomes 10.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>457145</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: <Angel of Grace>'s triggered ability doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain life, even if that damage would reduce your life total to less than 1.
2019/01/25: <Angel of Grace>'s triggered ability doesn't stop loss of life from effects that say that you lose life.
2019/01/25: If you have less than 1 life and somehow haven't lost the game, damage dealt to you reduces your life total further below 0 (as normal).
2019/01/25: For a player's life total to become 10, that player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is 2, <Angel of Grace>'s last ability will cause you to gain 8 life; alternatively, if your life total is 20, it will cause you to lose 10 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2019/01/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, after resolving <Angel of Grace>'s triggered ability, damage dealt to you and/or your teammate that would reduce your team's life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.
2019/01/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the activated ability of <Angel of Grace> causes you to gain or lose life so that your team's life total becomes 10.
2019/01/25: In a Commander game, combat damage you're dealt by a commander is still tracked, even if it doesn't change your life total.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans and "scryed" if applicable. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. Then the first turn begins.
2019/01/25: If you reveal two Sphinxes of Foresight from your opening hand, you'll scry 3 twice; you won't scry 6. Any cards you put on top of your library the first time you scry 3 will be part of the second time you scry 3.</Rulings>

2019/01/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as a spectacle cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/01/25: A card's spectacle cost is the same no matter how much life your opponents lost or how many opponents lost life.
2019/01/25: In a multiplayer game, if an opponent loses life and later that turn leaves the game, you can cast a spell for its spectacle cost. (If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues without an active player.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: <Light Up the Stage> doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
2019/01/25: Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2019/01/25: If you don't play a card exiled this way, it remains in exile.
2019/01/25: Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
2019/01/25: Spectacle doesn't change when you can cast the card. For example, you can't cast a sorcery with spectacle during an opponent's turn unless another effect allows you to do so, even if that player has lost life this turn.
2019/01/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as a spectacle cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/01/25: A card's spectacle cost is the same no matter how much life your opponents lost or how many opponents lost life.
2019/01/25: In a multiplayer game, if an opponent loses life and later that turn leaves the game, you can cast a spell for its spectacle cost. (If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues without an active player.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: All of the tokens enter the battlefield at the same time.
2019/01/25: Each token copies exactly what is printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature is copying something else, each token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature is copying.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2019/01/25: If the entering creature leaves the battlefield before <Mirror March>'s ability resolves, use that creature's last known existence on the battlefield to determine the token's characteristics.

<Watermark>Gruul</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>457273</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: The value of X is determined only as <Gruul Beastmaster>'s triggered ability resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if <Gruul Beastmaster>'s power changes.
2019/01/25: If <Gruul Beastmaster> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine the value of X.
2019/01/25: If <Gruul Beastmaster>'s power is negative as its triggered ability resolves, X is considered to be 0. In other words, that ability can't cause the creature to lose power.
2019/01/25: Riot is a replacement effect. Players can't respond to your choice of +1/+1 counter or haste, and they can't take actions while the creature is on the battlefield without one or the other.
2019/01/25: If a creature entering the battlefield has riot but can't have a +1/+1 counter put onto it, it gains haste.
2019/01/25: If you choose for the creature to gain haste, it gains haste indefinitely. It won't lose it as the turn ends or as another player gains control of it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Whether the entering creature shares a name with a creature you control or a creature card in your graveyard is checked both as that creature enters and as <Guardian Project>'s ability resolves. If the entering creature isn't the first of its name as it enters, the ability doesn't trigger at all; if its name is shared as the ability resolves, you don't draw a card.
2019/01/25: If the entering creature is put into your graveyard while <Guardian Project>'s ability is on the stack, that same card will be a creature card in your graveyard that shares a name with the creature that was on the battlefield, so you won't draw a card.
2019/01/25: If the entering creature leaves the battlefield and returns while <Guardian Project>'s ability is on the stack, that same card will be a new creature you control that shares a name with the creature that was on the battlefield, so you won't draw a card. However, <Guardian Project>'s ability may trigger for the new creature and you may draw a card as that ability resolves.
2019/01/25: A face-down creature has no name, so it can't share a name with anything. This includes other creatures with no name.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2019/01/25: Any change to a land's type or abilities gained by a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
2019/01/25: <Incubation Druid> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs or legality. For example, Spire of Industry says "{T}, Pay 1 life: Add one mana of any color. Activate this ability only if you control an artifact." If you control Spire of Industry and <Incubation Druid>, you can tap <Incubation Druid> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether you control an artifact, whether you can pay 1 life, or whether Spire of Industry is untapped.
2019/01/25: <Incubation Druid> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as those of Unclaimed Territory and Guildmages' Forum. It just produces one mana of the appropriate type, with no restrictions or riders.
2019/01/25: You can always activate an ability that will cause a creature to adapt. As that ability resolves, if the creature has a +1/+1 counter on it for any reason, you simply won't put any +1/+1 counters on it.
2019/01/25: If a creature somehow loses all of its +1/+1 counters, it can adapt again and get more +1/+1 counters.</Rulings>

<CardText>Captive Audience enters the battlefield under the control of an opponent of your choice.
At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one that hasn't been chosen —
• Your life total becomes 4.
• Discard your hand.
• Each opponent creates five 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens.</CardText>
<Artist>Dmitry Burmak</Artist>
<Watermark>Rakdos</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>457304</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: Once <Captive Audience> is controlled by your opponent, its ability triggers during that player's upkeep and that player makes all choices for it. That player is affected by its first two modes, and that player's opponents create the tokens for its last mode.
2019/01/25: For a player's life total to become 4, that player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if a player's life total is 20, <Captive Audience> will cause that player to lose 16 life; alternatively, if their life total is 1, it will cause them to gain 3 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2019/01/25: You may choose <Captive Audience>'s first mode even if your life total is already 4. Similarly, you may choose its second mode even if you have no cards in hand.
2019/01/25: If all three modes have been chosen, <Captive Audience>'s triggered ability is removed from the stack with no effect, but <Captive Audience> remains on the battlefield.
2019/01/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Captive Audience>'s first mode causes its controller to gain or lose life so that their team's life total becomes 4.
2019/01/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Captive Audience>'s owner leaves the game, <Captive Audience> leaves the game with them. If <Captive Audience>'s controller leaves the game, <Captive Audience> is exiled (assuming that player wasn't also <Captive Audience>'s owner).</Rulings>

2019/01/25: <Cindervines> can be the target of its own activated ability. The ability won't resolve since it won't have a legal target, and no player will be dealt damage, but this does allow you to sacrifice <Cindervines> without another enchantment to target if you want to.</Rulings>

2019/01/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as a spectacle cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.

Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant, but we're not going to tell the Gruul how to live their lives.</Rulings>

<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Watermark>Orzhov</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>457356</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/01/25: Teysa affects a creature's own "when this creature dies" triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that creature dies. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2019/01/25: Teysa's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to pay a cost for that triggered ability, are also made separately.
2019/01/25: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "creatures." In these cases, the trigger event may also refer to something being "put into a graveyard from the battlefield." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever an artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield" would trigger twice if an artifact creature dies while <Teysa Karlov> is on the battlefield.
2019/01/25: An ability that triggers when a creature "leaves the battlefield" will trigger twice if that creature leaves the battlefield by dying.
2019/01/25: An ability that triggers on an event that causes a creature to die doesn't trigger twice. For example, an ability that triggers "whenever you sacrifice a creature" triggers only once.
2019/01/25: Look at each creature as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if a land that has become a creature dies, an ability that triggers when it dies triggers twice.
2019/01/25: If a creature dying at the same time that another permanent you control leaves the battlefield causes a triggered ability of that permanent to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/01/25: If a creature dying at the same time as Teysa (including Teysa itself dying) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/01/25: If you somehow control two Teysas, a creature dying causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Teysa causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on. This also means that if you control Teysa and cast a second one, an ability that triggers when it dies due to the "legend rule" triggers three times.
2019/01/25: An ability of a permanent that triggers when a card is put into a graveyard "from anywhere" triggers twice only if Teysa and that permanent are both still on the battlefield immediately after the creature has died.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/01/25: Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
2019/01/25: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as afterlife, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2019/01/25: An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
2019/01/25: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.
2019/01/25: If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggered at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
2019/01/25: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2019/01/25: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Mirror Image), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2019/01/25: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.</Rulings>
