<ManaCost>1R (2)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Whenever you activate a loyalty ability of a Chandra planeswalker, you may pay {1}. If you do, copy that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy.
{1}, {T}, Discard a Mountain card or a red card: Draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Mathias Kollros</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: You can't pay {1} more than once for each time the triggered ability of <Chandra's Regulator> resolves.
2019/07/12: Copying a loyalty ability doesn't add or remove loyalty counters from any object.
2019/07/12: If the loyalty ability has −X in its cost, the copy uses the same value of X.
2019/07/12: The triggered ability of <Chandra's Regulator> and the copy it creates both resolve before the loyalty ability that caused it to trigger. They resolve even if that loyalty ability is countered.
2019/07/12: A Mountain card is a land card with the subtype Mountain, not any land card with a mana ability that produces red mana. Land cards are normally colorless, even if they produce red mana.</Rulings>

Other Wolves and Werewolves you control get +1/+1.
At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't cast a spell this turn, create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token.</CardText>
<Artist>Sam Rowan</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: A creature that's both a Wolf and a Werewolf gets only +1/+1 from <Nightpack Ambusher>'s ability.
2019/07/12: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other Wolves and Werewolves you control may become lethal if <Nightpack Ambusher> leaves the battlefield during that turn.
2019/07/12: <Nightpack Ambusher> looks at the entire turn to see if you have cast a spell, even if <Nightpack Ambusher> wasn't on the battlefield when that spell was cast. Notably, you won't get a Wolf token during your end step if you cast <Nightpack Ambusher> during your turn.
2019/07/12: If you cast a spell that was countered, <Nightpack Ambusher>'s last ability doesn't trigger.</Rulings>
