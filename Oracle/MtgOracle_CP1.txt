When Hydra Broodmaster becomes monstrous, create X X/X green Hydra creature tokens.</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: The value of each X in <Hydra Broodmaster>'s last ability is equal to the value chosen for X when its monstrosity ability was activated.
2014/04/26: Once a creature becomes monstrous, it can't become monstrous again. If the creature is already monstrous when the monstrosity ability resolves, nothing happens.
2014/04/26: Monstrous isn't an ability that a creature has. It's just something true about that creature. If the creature stops being a creature or loses its abilities, it will continue to be monstrous.
2014/04/26: An ability that triggers when a creature becomes monstrous won't trigger if that creature isn't on the battlefield when its monstrosity ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Anastasia Ovchinnikova</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/09/15: Creatures and lands you control untap at the same time as the active player's permanents. You can't choose to not untap them at that time.
2013/09/15: Effects that state a creature or land you control doesn't untap during your untap step won't apply during another player's untap step.
2013/09/15: Controlling more than one <Prophet of Kruphix> doesn't allow you to untap any creature or land more than once during a single untap step.
2013/09/15: If you're casting a creature spell with bestow, whether or not it has flash will depend on if you're casting it as a creature or as an Aura. <Prophet of Kruphix> won't give flash to a spell with bestow you're casting as an Aura.
2013/09/15: The last ability applies to creature cards in any zone, provided something is allowing you to cast them. For example, if you control a Zombie, you could cast Gravecrawler (a creature with "You may cast Gravecrawler from your graveyard as long as you control a Zombie") from your graveyard as though it had flash.</Rulings>
