As long as Honored Hierarch is renowned, it has vigilance and "{T}: Add one mana of any color."</CardText>
<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: Renown won't trigger when a creature deals combat damage to a planeswalker or another creature. It also won't trigger when a creature deals noncombat damage to a player.
2015/06/22: If a creature with renown deals combat damage to its controller because that damage was redirected, renown will trigger.
2015/06/22: If a renown ability triggers, but the creature leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, the creature doesn't become renowned. Any ability that triggers "whenever a creature becomes renowned" won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/09/20: Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
2014/09/20: Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
2014/09/20: Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.
2017/11/17: Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.</Rulings>

<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: Each Dragon you attack with will cause Dromoka's triggered ability to trigger. For each instance of the ability, you'll determine which creature to put +1/+1 counters on as it resolves. Specifically, the creature you control with the lowest toughness as the first such ability resolves may not have the lowest toughness as the second such ability resolves.
2014/11/24: Bolster itself doesn't target any creature, though some spells and abilities that bolster may have other effects that target creatures. For example, you could put counters on a creature with protection from white with Abzan Skycaptain's bolster ability.
2014/11/24: You determine which creature to put counters on as the spell or ability that instructs you to bolster resolves.</Rulings>
