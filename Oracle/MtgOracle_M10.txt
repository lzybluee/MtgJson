<Rulings>2009/10/01: As you cast <Harm's Way>, you target that the redirected damage will be dealt to. As <Harm's Way> resolves, you choose a source of damage. You never choose the original recipient of the damage; <Harm's Way> will apply to whatever the chosen source tries to deal damage to, as long as it's you or a permanent you control.
2009/10/01: If the chosen source would deal just 1 damage to you or a permanent you control, <Harm's Way>'s effect will redirect that damage and still have a "shield" left for another 1 damage from that source later in the turn.
2009/10/01: If the chosen source would simultaneously deal damage to multiple permanents you control (like Pyroclasm could) or to you and at least one permanent you control (like Earthquake could), <Harm's Way> will redirect just 2 of that damage. It won't redirect the next 2 damage that would be dealt to each recipient. You choose which 2 damage is redirected. If you like, you can choose to redirect 1 damage that would be dealt by the chosen source to each of two different recipients.
2009/10/01: After <Harm's Way> resolves, it no longer checks to see if the target is a legal target. However, if that permanent or player can't be dealt damage at the time the chosen source would deal damage (perhaps because the creature is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a creature, or because the player is no longer in the game), the damage can't be redirected. It's dealt to the original recipient.
2009/10/01: <Harm's Way> has no effect on damage that's already been dealt.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: If an effect would simultaneously destroy <Indestructibility> and the creature it's enchanting, only <Indestructibility> is destroyed.
2013/07/01: Lethal damage, damage from a source with deathtouch, and effects that say "destroy" won't cause a permanent with indestructible to be put into the graveyard. However, a permanent with indestructible can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, if it's a planeswalker and another planeswalker with the same subtype is controlled by the same player, if it's a creature with toughness 0 or less, or if it's an Aura that's either unattached or attached to something illegal.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted by <Indestructibility> is dealt lethal damage, the creature isn't destroyed, but the damage remains marked on the creature. If <Indestructibility> stops enchanting that creature later in the turn, the creature will no longer have indestructible and will be destroyed.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: After the ability resolves, the targeted creature attacks you only if it's able to do so as that turn's declare attackers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," it can't attack. If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2009/10/01: If the targeted creature would be able to attack either you or a planeswalker you control, it must attack you, not the planeswalker.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability during your opponent's turn after attackers have been declared will have no effect. The same is true if you activate the ability during your own turn.</Rulings>

2007/07/15: If the chosen creature is a token, <Clone> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. <Clone> is not a token.
2007/07/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Clone> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2009/10/01: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2012/07/01: <Clone> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2012/07/01: If <Clone> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Clone> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2012/07/01: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Clone> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>190556</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Hive Mind>'s effect is mandatory. Each other player must copy the spell whether they want to or not.
2009/10/01: <Hive Mind> will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2009/10/01: If a player casts an instant or sorcery spell, <Hive Mind>'s ability triggers and is put on the stack on top of that spell. <Hive Mind>'s ability will resolve first. When it does, it creates a number of copies of that spell equal to the number of players in the game minus one. First the player whose turn it is (or, if that's the player who cast the original spell, the player to that player's left) puts their copy on the stack, choosing new targets for it if they like. Then each other player in turn order does the same. The last copy put on the stack will be the first one that resolves. (Note that the very last thing to happen is that the original spell resolves.)
2009/10/01: The copies that <Hive Mind>'s ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Hive Mind>'s ability itself) won't trigger.
2009/10/01: Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless its controller chooses new ones. That player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A player can't choose a different one.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2009/10/01: A copy's controller can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2009/10/01: If a copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if a copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Once you've chosen a card during your search, you must clearly indicate which card you've chosen (preferably without showing the front of that card to the player!). Then the player names a card.
2009/10/01: After the player names a card, check if the card you chose has that name. If it doesn't, but it's a creature card, you may put it onto the battlefield. If you don't want to put that card onto the battlefield, it's not a creature card, or it does have the name the player said, it simply stays in that player's library without ever being revealed. The player then shuffles their library, including that card.
2009/10/01: A "creature card" is any card with the type creature, even if it has other types such as artifact, enchantment, or land. Older cards of type summon are also creature cards.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/06/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2005/06/01: <Twincast> copies any text spliced onto the targeted spell, but you can't splice additional text onto the copy.
2009/10/01: <Twincast> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2009/10/01: As <Twincast> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2009/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2009/10/01: If the spell <Twincast> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2009/10/01: If the spell <Twincast> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2009/10/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: When the ability resolves, if you control any other creatures, you must sacrifice one of them. You lose life only if no creature can be sacrificed.
2009/10/01: If you have two <Xathrid Demon>s, both abilities will trigger at the beginning of your upkeep. When the first Demon's ability resolves, you can sacrifice the second Demon to satisfy the requirement ("Sacrifice a creature other than <Xathrid Demon>" really means "Sacrifice a creature other than this creature"). When the second Demon's ability resolves, you must sacrifice another creature. If you can't (because the first Demon has somehow left the battlefield and you control no other creatures), you lose 7 life, regardless of whether the second Demon is still on the battlefield at this time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: "Can't attack alone" means <Jackal Familiar> can't be declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step unless at least one other creature is also declared as an attacker at that time (either by you or your Two-Headed Giant teammate).
2009/10/01: "Can't block alone" has a similar meaning. Note that the other blocker(s) doesn't have to block the same attacker as <Jackal Familiar>.
2009/10/01: Once <Jackal Familiar> has been legally declared as an attacking or blocking creature, how many other creatures it's attacking or blocking with no longer matters.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This card has a triggered ability that causes a separate effect for 1 point of damage each time a land is tapped for mana.
2009/10/01: This ability is not a mana ability. It goes on the stack and can be responded to.
2009/10/01: The ability will trigger each time a land is tapped for mana. Each ability is separate.
2009/10/01: If any lands are tapped for mana while a player is casting a spell or activating an ability, <Manabarbs>'s ability will trigger that many times and wait. When the player finishes casting that spell or activating that ability, it's put on the stack, then <Manabarbs>'s triggered abilities are put on the stack on top of it. The <Manabarbs> abilities will resolve first.
2009/10/01: On the other hand, a player can tap lands for mana, let the <Manabarbs> triggered abilities be put on the stack, and then respond to those abilities by casting an instant or activating an ability using that mana. In that case, the spell or ability will resolve first.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>190187</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/10/15: Anything that triggers during the resolution of this will wait to be put on the stack until everything is put onto the battlefield and resolution is complete. The player whose turn it is will put all of their triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
2009/10/01: Taking it slowly, here's what happens when <Warp World> resolves: 1) Each player counts the number of permanents they own. 2) Each player shuffles those permanents into their library. 3) Each player reveals cards from the top of their library equal to the number that player counted. 4) Each player puts all artifact, land, and creature cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. All of these cards enter the battlefield at the same time. 5) Each player puts all enchantment cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way can enchant an artifact, land, or creature that was already put onto the battlefield, but can't enchant an enchantment that's being put onto the battlefield at the same time as it. If multiple players have Auras to put onto the battlefield, the player whose turn it is announces what their Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all enchantments (both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time. 6) Each player puts all of their other revealed cards (instants, sorceries, planeswalkers, and Auras that can't enchant anything) on the bottom of their library in any order.
2009/10/01: Tokens are permanents but not cards. They'll count toward the number of permanents shuffled into your library, so you'll get a card back for each token you owned. But the tokens themselves should be ignored while you're revealing *cards* from your library. In practice, you shouldn't actually shuffle them into your library since they'll cease to exist as soon as <Warp World> finishes resolving. Note that a token's owner is the player under whose control it first entered the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: Activating <Cudgel Troll>'s ability causes a "regeneration shield" to be created for it. The next time <Cudgel Troll> would be destroyed that turn, the regeneration shield is used up instead. This works only if <Cudgel Troll> is dealt lethal damage, dealt damage from a source with deathtouch, or affected by a spell or ability that says to "destroy" it. Other effects that cause <Cudgel Troll> to be put into the graveyard (such as reducing its toughness to 0 or sacrificing it) don't destroy it, so regeneration won't save it. If it hasn't been used, the regeneration shield goes away as the turn ends.
2010/08/15: To work, the regeneration shield must be created before <Cudgel Troll> is destroyed. This usually means activating its ability during the declare blockers step, or in response to a spell or ability that would destroy it.
2010/08/15: If <Cudgel Troll> is dealt lethal damage and is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch during the same combat damage step, a single regeneration shield will save it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: All Wolves you control are tapped as part of the activated ability's effect, not as a cost. Players may respond by attempting to tap or untap Wolves, or to create or remove them.
2018/03/16: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time <Master of the Wild Hunt>'s ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You won't tap your Wolves, and nothing will deal or be dealt damage.
2018/03/16: Only a Wolf creature tapped as part of the ability's effect can be dealt damage by the target creature.
2018/03/16: The controller of the target creature doesn't divide that creature's damage as the ability is activated (since the Wolves that will receive that damage aren't targeted), so that player does so as the ability resolves. There is no time to react between the time a Wolf is chosen, the time damage is dealt to it, and the time it's destroyed for having been dealt lethal damage. If you want to put a regeneration shield on one of those Wolves, or target it with a damage-prevention spell, or anything else, you must do so before the ability resolves (and before you know which Wolves will be chosen and how much damage will be dealt to them).</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>189900</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Prized Unicorn> doesn't give a creature the ability to block it. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block it to do so. For example, it can't force a creature that's tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block to block it. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to block <Prized Unicorn> in that case either.
2009/10/01: If a creature the defending player controls can't block <Prized Unicorn>, it can block any attacking creature, or not block at all.
2009/10/01: If two <Prized Unicorn>s are attacking, each creature the defending player controls can block either one of them. (The defending player chooses.) A creature that can block multiple creatures, like Palace Guard, must block both of them.</Rulings>

If the amount of damage that would be dealt to <Protean Hydra> is greater than the number of +1/+1 counters on it, all the +1/+1 counters on <Protean Hydra> are removed from it.
2009/10/01: If unpreventable damage is dealt to <Protean Hydra>, the Hydra's second ability will try to prevent it and fail (meaning that damage has its normal results), and it will also remove that many +1/+1 counters from <Protean Hydra>.
2009/10/01: <Protean Hydra>'s last ability triggers whenever a +1/+1 counter is removed from it for any reason, not just when a +1/+1 counter is removed by its second ability.
2009/10/01: If multiple +1/+1 counters are removed from <Protean Hydra> at once, its last ability will trigger that many times.
2009/10/01: If a -1/-1 counter is put on <Protean Hydra> while it has +1/+1 counters on it, that -1/-1 counter and a +1/+1 counter will be removed from it as a state-based action. This will cause <Protean Hydra>'s last ability to trigger.
2009/10/01: If any +1/+1 counters are removed from <Protean Hydra> during the end step, its last ability will trigger and set up a delayed triggered ability that will trigger at the beginning of the next end step (which is near the end of the following turn).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/07/01: Lethal damage, damage from a source with deathtouch, and effects that say "destroy" won't cause a creature with indestructible to be put into the graveyard. However, a creature with indestructible can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed or if its toughness is 0 or less. (In these cases, of course, <Darksteel Colossus> would be shuffled into its owner's library instead of being put into its owner's graveyard.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Magebane Armor> can equip a creature that doesn't have flying. The "lose flying" effect just won't do anything in that case.
2009/10/01: <Magebane Armor> causes the equipped creature to lose flying at the time it became equipped. Any ability that grants that creature flying that starts to work later (such as a Jump that resolves later, or a Levitation that comes under your control later) will work normally.
2009/10/01: Combat damage is the damage that's dealt automatically by attacking and blocking creatures, even if it's redirected (by Harm's Way, perhaps). Noncombat damage is any other damage (generally, it's damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability).</Rulings>

For example, a player can't cycle Eternal Dragon or return an Eternal Dragon from their graveyard to hand if <Pithing Needle> naming Eternal Dragon is on the battlefield.
2005/06/01: You can name any card, even if that card doesn't normally have an activated ability. You can't name a token unless that token has the same name as a card.
2005/06/01: If you name a card that has both a mana ability and another activated ability, the mana ability can be activated but the other ability can't be activated.

You keep playing.
2009/10/01: Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game, however. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your _Magic Online_(R) game clock runs out of time.
