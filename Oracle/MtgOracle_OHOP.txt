<Rulings>2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: <Academy at Tolaria West>'s first ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you have no cards in hand as your end step begins, and (2) the ability will do nothing unless you have no cards in hand by the time it resolves.
2009/10/01: If you discard your hand as a result of rolling {CHAOS}, <Academy at Tolaria West>'s first ability will then trigger at the beginning of your end step (unless you planeswalk or somehow put a card in your hand before then).</Rulings>

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: <Agyrem>'s first and second abilities each set up a delayed triggered ability. These abilities will trigger at the beginning of the next end step even if <Agyrem> is no longer the face-up plane card.
2009/10/01: <Agyrem>'s first ability will return a card to the battlefield only if it's still in the graveyard by the time the delayed triggered ability resolves. Similarly, <Agyrem>'s second ability will return a card to its owner's hand only if it's still in the graveyard by the time the delayed triggered ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its color.
2009/10/01: A creature that caused either of <Agyrem>'s first two abilities to trigger will be returned at the beginning of the next end step even if it's not a creature card. (For example, if it's a Treetop Village.)
2009/10/01: If a token creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, one of <Agyrem>'s first two abilities will trigger, but the token will cease to exist long before it would be returned somewhere.
2009/10/01: If multiple creatures are put into their owners' graveyards at the same time (due to combat damage or Planar Cleansing, for example), <Agyrem>'s first two abilities trigger that many times. At the beginning of the next end step, the player whose turn it is at that time puts all of their <Agyrem> delayed triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last ability put on the stack is the first one that resolves. The creatures are returned one at a time.
2009/10/01: If you're affected by the chaos ability, creatures will still be able to attack planeswalkers you control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. Note that if a creature has multiple instances of exalted, each one triggers separately. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
2009/10/01: If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
2009/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until the turn ends. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
2009/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.
2009/10/01: Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared.
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2013/07/01: A creature with a divinity counter put on it due to the chaos ability retains indestructible even after <Bant> stops being the face-up plane card.
2013/07/01: If all divinity counters on a creature are moved to a different creature, the indestructible ability doesn't move along with them. The first creature no longer has indestructible because it no longer has a divinity counter on it. The second creature doesn't have indestructible because the chaos ability didn't target it.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is.

2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: For two players to exchange life totals, what actually happens is that each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if Player A has 5 life and Player B has 3 life before the exchange, Player A will lose 2 life and Player B will gain 2 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2009/10/01: Neither permanent you target with the chaos ability needs to be one you control.
2009/10/01: The control-change effect has no duration. For each permanent, it will last until the game ends or the permanent leaves the battlefield. It will override all previous control-change effects for those permanents, and may be overridden by a later control-change effect.
2009/10/01: Both permanents targeted by the chaos ability may be controlled by the same player. If they are, the effect nothing.
2009/10/01: If either permanent targeted by the chaos ability is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the exchange doesn't happen. If both targets become illegal, the ability doesn't resolve.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Other than choices involving modes or additional costs, the copies are created based on what they could target if the spell were cast anew. For example, if a player casts Naturalize ("Destroy target artifact or enchantment") targeting an artifact, <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability will copy it for each artifact and enchantment it could target (and each copy will target a different one of those), not just for each artifact it could target.

2009/10/01: The copies that <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability itself) won't trigger.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. Its controller can't choose a different one.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2009/10/01: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2009/10/01: As a token is created by the chaos ability, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.

2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: Despite the appearance of the reminder text, the unearth abilities that <Grixis> grants are activated abilities of each individual blue, black, and/or red creature card in a graveyard. They're not activated abilities of <Grixis>.
2009/10/01: A card's mana cost includes its color.
2009/10/01: <Grixis> may cause a creature card in a graveyard to have multiple unearth abilities. Its owner may activate any one of those abilities.
2009/10/01: If you activate a creature card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2009/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Essence Scatter) will not.
2009/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature if it would eventually leave the battlefield.
2009/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the exile abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2009/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.
2009/10/01: Unlike the unearth ability, the chaos ability returns a creature card from a graveyard to the battlefield indefinitely.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Creatures may have negative power. For example, a 3/4 creature that gets -5/-0 becomes -2/4. The total of its power and toughness is 2. It would need +3/+0 to raise its power to 1.
2009/10/01: A creature that would assign 0 or less combat damage (due to having power 0 or less) doesn't assign combat damage at all.

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: If a creature controlled by a player other than the planar controller enters the battlefield, the planar controller (not the creature's controller) controls <Immersturm>'s triggered ability. That means that if multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, that player controls all of <Immersturm>'s triggered abilities and may put them on the stack in whichever order they like. The last one put on the stack is the first one to resolve.
2009/10/01: When the chaos ability resolves, the targeted creature is exiled, then immediately returned to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence.
2009/10/01: Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" choices for the card returned by the chaos ability are made by that card's owner, not its old controller or the controller of the chaos ability.
2009/10/01: A token that has left the battlefield can't come back onto the battlefield. If the chaos ability exiles a token, that token remains in exile until state-based actions are checked, then it ceases to exist.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: As a token is created by <Isle of Vesuva>'s first ability, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on.

2009/10/01: The chaos ability will destroy all creatures with the same name as the target creature, not just tokens created by <Isle of Vesuva>'s first ability. It doesn't matter who controls them.
2009/10/01: If the permanent targeted by the chaos ability has become an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve. Nothing will be destroyed.
2009/10/01: A token's name is the same as the creature types listed by the effect that created it, unless the token copies a permanent or that effect specifically gives that token a name. For example, the effect of The Fourth Sphere's chaos ability creates a token with the name "Zombie."
2009/10/01: A face-down creature has no name, so it doesn't have the same name as anything else.
2009/10/01: If the creature that caused <Isle of Vesuva>'s first ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, the ability still creates a token. It will have the copiable values of the characteristics of that nontoken creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If the permanent targeted by the chaos ability isn't destroyed (because it regenerates, or because it has indestructible), all other permanents with the same name as it will still be destroyed.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: <Minamo>'s first ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger.
2009/10/01: The chaos ability doesn't target the cards it will return, so they're not chosen until resolution. As the ability resolves, first the active player may choose a blue card in their graveyard, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all cards chosen this way are returned to their owners' hands. Once a card is chosen, it's too late for players to respond.</Rulings>

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: If you use a card's flashback ability, you're actually casting that card. It moves from your graveyard to the stack. Abilities that trigger when you cast a spell will trigger. That spell can be countered.
2009/10/01: If you cast a card by using flashback, you cast that card from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost, but everything else about casting that spell works normally. You must follow timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery), as well as other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only before blockers are declared"). You may pay additional costs (such as kicker). Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will apply.
2009/10/01: As a spell cast with flashback resolves, it never goes to its owner's graveyard, so abilities that trigger on cards being put in a graveyard won't trigger. The card is exiled instead.
2009/10/01: If a spell cast by using flashback is countered, it's still exiled rather than being put into its owner's graveyard.
2009/10/01: If you use the flashback ability granted by <Otaria> to cast a split card from your graveyard, the flashback cost you pay is equal to the mana cost of the half that you're casting.
2009/10/01: If you use the flashback ability granted by <Otaria> to cast a card with X in its mana cost from your graveyard, you choose the value of X as you cast it. You'll still have to pay that X.
2009/10/01: <Otaria> may cause an instant or sorcery card in a graveyard to have multiple flashback abilities. Its owner may cast it using any one of those abilities.

2009/10/01: Wither applies to any damage, not just combat damage.
2009/10/01: The -1/-1 counters that result from wither remain on the damaged creature indefinitely. They won't be removed if the creature regenerates or the turn ends.
2009/10/01: Since damage from a creature with wither is real damage, it follows all the other rules for damage. It can be prevented or redirected. When it's dealt, it will cause "Whenever [this creature] deals damage" and "Whenever [this creature] is dealt damage" abilities to trigger.
2009/10/01: If the source of the damage is still on the battlefield at the time that damage is dealt, its characteristics are checked to see if it has wither. If the source has left the battlefield by then, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see if it had wither.
2009/10/01: Damage from creatures with wither affects players and planeswalkers normally.

Any creature that attacks in the second combat phase will remain tapped during the third combat phase (unless you roll {CHAOS} again).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: <Stronghold Furnace>'s first ability interacts with all damage, not just combat damage. Notably, it doubles the damage from its own chaos ability.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Suppose a spell would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let <Stronghold Furnace>'s effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
2009/10/01: If a spell or ability divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Pyrotechnics does), the damage is divided before <Stronghold Furnace>'s effect doubles it. The same is true for combat damage.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If multiple creatures deal combat damage to a player, the first ability of <Undercity Reaches> triggers multiple times.
2009/10/01: If a creature deals combat damage to a player, the controller of <Undercity Reaches> controls the ability that triggers, but the controller of the creature decides whether to draw a card.
2009/10/01: The chaos ability's effect continues to apply even after <Undercity Reaches> stops being the face-up plane card.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then roll {CHAOS} while <Undercity Reaches> is the face-up plane card, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those events had happened in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two for as long as Null Profusion is on the battlefield.</Rulings>
