<Rulings>2016/06/08: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Swampcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Swamp card. After you find a Swamp card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2016/06/08: Swampcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Swampcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Swampcycling from being activated.
2016/06/08: Swampcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Swampcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2016/06/08: You can choose to find any card with the Swamp land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Swamp card in your library.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>
<Artist>Anthony Jones</Artist>
<Multiverseid>265167</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>
