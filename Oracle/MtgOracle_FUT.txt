When Angel of Salvation enters the battlefield, prevent the next 5 damage that would be dealt this turn to any number of targets, divided as you choose.</CardText>
<Artist>D. Alexander Gregory</Artist>
<Multiverseid>130345</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: You choose how the damage prevention shields will be divided when you put the triggered ability on the stack. The number of targets must be at least one and at most five.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126204</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: <Chronomantic Escape> can affect creatures that aren't on the battlefield at the time it resolves, because it modifies the announcement of an attack, not the creatures on the battlefield. For example, if <Chronomantic Escape> resolves on your turn, then on your opponent's turn they cast a creature with haste, that creature can't attack that turn.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2014/02/01: Unless some effect explicitly says otherwise, a creature that can't attack you can still attack a planeswalker you control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

2007/05/01: <Nix> doesn't check whether a spell's mana cost is 0. Rather, it checks how much mana was actually spent to cast it. It can counter a spell with mana cost 0 (such as Slaughter Pact), a spell cast via an alternative nonmana cost (such as Allosaurus Rider) or alternative cost of {0} (such as Basking Rootwalla), a spell whose cost to cast it was reduced to 0 (such as Frogmite), a spell cast without paying its cost due to an effect (such as suspend or Mindleech Mass's ability), or a copy of a spell, among other possibilities. It will not counter a spell that had an additional or alternative mana cost paid to cast it, regardless of that spell's converted mana cost (such as a face-down spell cast with morph, or an Ornithopter cast while Trinisphere is on the battlefield, for example).

<Rulings>2007/05/01: This Aura targets, and enchants, an instant card in a graveyard. This is the first Aura that enchants something that's neither a permanent nor a player.
2007/05/01: The Aura will be on the battlefield attached to a card in a different zone. The Aura won't be in the graveyard. The enchanted card won't be on the battlefield.
2007/05/01: If the enchanted card changes zones (due to being cast with flashback, or being exiled with Cremate, for example), <Spellweaver Volute> "falls off" and is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2007/05/01: When you cast a sorcery spell, <Spellweaver Volute>'s ability triggers. It will make a copy of the enchanted card. The copy will exist in the graveyard. You'll have the option to cast the copy. If you don't, the copy remains in the graveyard and ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked. If you do cast the copy, the copy is cast from the graveyard. After you finish casting it, the enchanted card is exiled and you must choose a new instant card in a graveyard to attach <Spellweaver Volute> to. If you can't, <Spellweaver Volute> remains on the battlefield attached to nothing and is then put into the graveyard the next time state-based actions are checked.
2007/05/01: Say <Spellweaver Volute>'s ability triggers, then the enchanted instant card is exiled in response. <Spellweaver Volute>, which is now enchanting nothing, is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. When the Volute's ability resolves, it will check its last existence on the battlefield and identify the "enchanted card" as "nothing," so no copy is created.
2007/05/01: Say <Spellweaver Volute>'s ability triggers, then <Spellweaver Volute> leaves the battlefield in response. Then the instant card that was enchanted is removed from the graveyard in response. When the Volute's ability resolves, it will check its last existence on the battlefield and identify the "enchanted card" as that instant card, so the card is copied and controller of the triggered ability may cast it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Brandon Kitkouski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126131</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>136206</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: If a token is put into an opponent's graveyard from the battlefield, or a copy of a spell is put into an opponent's graveyard from the stack, <Nihilith>'s ability will not trigger, because the ability references "a card."
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/05/01: This removes all abilities on all cards in all graveyards — both the ones that matter in a graveyard (dredge, Chronosavant's ability, etc.) and those that don't.
2007/05/01: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, that ability triggers from the battlefield (such as Deadwood Treefolk or Epochrasite, for example), they won't be affected by <Yixlid Jailer>.
2007/05/01: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a graveyard from anywhere other than the battlefield, that ability triggers from the graveyard, (such as Krosan Tusker, Narcomoeba, or Quagnoth, for example). <Yixlid Jailer> will prevent those abilities from triggering at all.
2007/05/01: If an ability triggers when the object that has it is put into a hidden zone from a graveyard, that ability triggers from the graveyard, (such as Golgari Brownscale), <Yixlid Jailer> will prevent that ability from triggering.
2007/05/01: Some replacement effects cause a card to be put somewhere else instead of being put into a graveyard (such as Legacy Weapon). These effects mean the card is never actually put into the graveyard, so <Yixlid Jailer> can't affect it.
2007/05/01: Some cards have abilities that modify how they're put onto the battlefield. For example, Scarwood Treefolk says "Scarwood Treefolk is put onto the battlefield tapped" and Triskelion says "Triskelion enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it." Although these cards won't have these abilities in the graveyard, they will be applied if the cards are put onto the battlefield from the graveyard (due to Zombify, perhaps). What matters is that these cards will have these abilities on the battlefield.
2007/05/01: If Mistform Ultimus is in the graveyard, the Ultimus will lose its ability that says "Mistform Ultimus is every creature type," but it will still *be* all creature types.

You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.

Suspend 4—{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {R} and exile it with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Dave Kendall</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126201</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: When <Shivan Sand-Mage> enters the battlefield, if there are no suspended cards and no permanents with time counters on them, you can't choose the second mode. You'll have to choose the first mode, and will have to choose a permanent as a target (though, in this case, the ability won't do anything when it resolves).
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Slivercycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Sliver card. After you find a Sliver card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Slivercycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Slivercycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Plainscycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Slivercycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Slivercycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Sliver creature type, even if it isn't a creature card. This includes, for example, Tribal cards with the Changeling ability. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Sliver card in your library.
2013/07/01: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like flying, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.
2013/07/01: If the creature type of a Sliver changes so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.

2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>132218</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>130634</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: Mana from any source other than a land with the supertype "basic" can't be spent to cast <Imperiosaur>.
2007/05/01: Many mana-producing effects (such as Heartbeat of Spring or Utopia Sprawl, for example) add mana to a player's mana pool whenever a land becomes tapped. This mana is produced by the enchantment, not the land, so it can't be used to pay for <Imperiosaur>.
2007/05/01: A small number of effects (Pulse of Llanowar and Hall of Gemstone, for example) state that a land "produces" certain mana instead of what it would normally produce. If the land is basic, then mana produced this way can be spent to cast <Imperiosaur>.
2007/05/01: If a basic land gains a mana ability (from Riftstone Portal, Joiner Adept, or Rain of Filth, for example), the mana produced this way can be used to cast for <Imperiosaur>.
2007/05/01: <Imperiosaur>'s restriction applies to the total cost to cast it. If there are any additional costs (such as from Feroz's Ban, for example), those costs would have to be paid with mana produced by basic lands as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/05/01: <Muraganda Petroglyphs> gives a bonus only to creatures that have no rules text at all. This includes true vanilla creatures (such as Grizzly Bears), face-down creatures, many tokens, and creatures that have lost their abilities (due to Ovinize, for example). Any ability of any kind, whether or not the ability functions in the on the battlefield zone, including things like "Cycling {2}" means the creature doesn't get the bonus.
2007/05/01: Animated basic lands have mana abilities, so they won't get the bonus.
2007/05/01: Some Auras and Equipment grant abilities to creatures, meaning the affected creature would no longer get the +2/+2 bonus. For example, Flight grants flying to the enchanted creature. Other Auras and Equipment do not, meaning the affected creature would continue to get the +2/+2 bonus. For example, Dehydration states something now true about the enchanted creature, but doesn't give it any abilities. Auras and Equipment that grant abilities will use the words "gains" or "has," and they'll list a keyword ability or an ability in quotation marks.

<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126215</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: The triggered ability checks the power and toughness of a creature that enters the battlefield as it exists once it's on the battlefield. For example, Triskelion has 1/1 printed on it, but it enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it, so it actually enters the battlefield as a 4/4 creature. <Sword of the Meek>'s ability wouldn't trigger. Ditto for a Llanowar Elves that enters the battlefield while you control Gaea's Anthem.
2007/05/01: If a 1/1 creature that could not be equipped by <Sword of the Meek> enters the battlefield under your control, you may return <Sword of the Meek> to the battlefield when the ability resolves. The Sword will fail to become attached to the creature, but it will remain on the battlefield.
2007/05/01: If multiple 1/1 creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, the Sword's ability will trigger that many times. Only the first ability to resolve will return the Sword to the battlefield and attach it to a creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/05/01: Fortification is to lands what Equipment is to creatures. Except for the difference regarding what kind of permanent it can affect, Fortifications and Equipment follow the same rules.
2007/05/01: If <Darksteel Garrison> and the fortified land would be destroyed at the same time, only <Darksteel Garrison> is destroyed.
2007/05/01: The second ability triggers whenever the fortified land becomes tapped, not just when it's tapped for mana.
2007/05/01: The triggered ability is mandatory. If you don't have a creature to target, you must target another player's creature, if possible.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>136196</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: Forest is a land type. Dryad is a creature type.
2007/05/01: <Dryad Arbor> is played as a land. It doesn't use the stack, it's not a spell, it can't be responded to, it has no mana cost, and it counts as your land play for the turn.
2007/05/01: If a <Dryad Arbor> gains flash, or you have the ability to play <Dryad Arbor> as though it had flash (due to Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir or Scout's Warning, for example), you can ignore the normal timing rules for playing a land, but not any other restrictions. You can't play <Dryad Arbor> during another player's turn, and you can't play <Dryad Arbor> if it's your turn and you've already played a land.
2011/09/22: If <Dryad Arbor> is changed into another basic land type (such as by Sea's Claim), it continues to be a creature and a Dryad.
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.</Rulings>
