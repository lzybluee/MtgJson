<CardText>Each player chooses a number of lands they control equal to the number of lands controlled by the player who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players discard cards and sacrifice creatures the same way.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Multiverseid>202501</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>BBBB (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>As Lich enters the battlefield, you lose life equal to your life total.
You don't lose the game for having 0 or less life.
If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead.
Whenever you're dealt damage, sacrifice that many nontoken permanents. If you can't, you lose the game.
When Lich is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you lose the game.</CardText>
<Artist>Daniel Gelon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>202483</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you have multiple <Lich> cards on the battlefield, you must sacrifice a permanent for each damage done to you for each <Lich>. This is because the sacrifice is a triggered ability. But you only draw one card for each life gained regardless of how many <Lich>es you have. This is because the draw is a replacement effect and not a triggered one. You lose if any one of the <Lich>es leaves the battlefield.
2004/10/04: If you take more than one damage at a time, sacrifice the permanents for that damage simultaneously. This allows you to sacrifice both a creature and any Aura that is on it all at once.
2004/10/04: You can't pay life, just like any player at less than one life can't pay life. You can pay zero life if you want.
2004/10/04: If an opponent steals control of <Lich> and no other effect prevents you from losing with a life total of zero, you will lose the game due to a zero life total as a State-Based Action before you can take any actions. The last sentence doesn't apply in this case since the <Lich> didn't leave the battlefield.
2004/10/04: If an opponent steals control of <Lich>, their life total does not change. The life total changes for a player only when it enters the battlefield under that player's control.
2004/10/04: You can lose life and take damage, and thereby have a negative life total, while <Lich> is on the battlefield.
2010/08/15: The last ability will cause you to lose the game even if you somehow manage to have a life total greater than 0 at the time the <Lich> leaves the battlefield or if some other effect would prevent you from losing for having 0 life. If, on the other hand, some effect such as that from Platinum Angel says that you can't lose the game then even the last ability of the <Lich> cannot cause you to do so. The ability will just resolve and the game will continue as normal.
2010/08/15: Note that usually you will have 0 or less life at the time <Lich> leaves the battlefield causing you to lose as a State-Based Action before the last ability can even go on the stack.
2011/01/01: The last ability will cause you to lose the game even if you somehow manage to have a life total greater than 0 at the time the <Lich> is put into the graveyard or if some other effect would prevent you from losing for having 0 life. If, on the other hand, some effect such as that from Platinum Angel says that you can't lose the game then even the last ability of the <Lich> cannot cause you to do so. The ability will just resolve and the game will continue as normal.</Rulings>

<CardText>Look at target opponent's hand and choose a card from it. You control that player until Word of Command finishes resolving. The player plays that card if able. While doing so, the player can activate mana abilities only if they're from lands that player controls and only if mana they produce is spent to activate other mana abilities of lands the player controls and/or to play that card. If the chosen card is cast as a spell, you control the player while that spell is resolving.</CardText>
<Artist>Jesper Myrfors</Artist>
<Multiverseid>202591</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: To "play a card" is to either cast a spell or to put a land onto the battlefield using the main phase special action.
2009/10/01: You do get to choose which lands get tapped. You can make them choose an optional mana generating ability of the land that they tap, such as making them tap and sacrifice the land instead of just tap it.
2011/01/01: <Word of Command> can't be used to force a player to play a card that isn't in their hand.
2011/01/01: You control the player while this spell is resolving, which means you get to see anything they can see. If that player is required to search their library as part of playing the card or as part of its resolution if it's cast as a spell, then you can see the cards in that player's library as well.
2011/01/01: Your opponent can't counter the <Word of Command> after letting you look at their hand, but they can attempt to counter the spell you force them to cast.
2011/01/01: You may Command your opponent to play a land (if they have not already done so this turn).
2011/01/01: You must order your opponent to play the chosen card if it is possible to do so.
2011/01/01: If there is a non-mana way to cast a spell, as with Pitch Spells, you may require that way to be used if it is possible to do so.
2011/01/01: Since this spell is an instant, your opponent gets a chance to respond to it as normal. Once this spell resolves, you look at your opponent's hand and choose a card. Note that it is common practice to respond to <Word of Command> by using up any spells or mana you have prior to letting it resolve.
2011/01/01: During the resolution of this spell, that player plays the chosen card.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This effect does not apply to effects which reduce your life without doing damage.
2004/10/04: The ability works up until Ali enters the graveyard, so if he takes lethal damage or is destroyed at the same time you take damage, the ability helps you. If the damage occurs after it goes to the graveyard, however, it is not affected by the Ali which is no longer on the battlefield.
2004/10/04: This effect does not prevent damage, it prevents the damage from turning into loss of life. So the full damage is dealt (and abilities that trigger on damage being dealt still trigger), but the full loss of life is not applied.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>221511</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: When a spell with additional costs is copied, you don't have to pay those costs again.
2004/10/04: For spells that can have a variable number of targets, the controller of the copy must use the same number of targets the original spell did.
2004/10/04: <Fork>ing a spell with an X in the cost requires you to use the same X value.
2004/10/04: <Fork> will not copy changes made by modifying effects to the spell prior to the use of <Fork>, such as text-changing effects.
2004/10/04: If mana or other costs need to be spent at resolution of the spell, the player of <Fork> would still be responsible for paying that cost.
2004/10/04: You need not (and may not) pay any additional mana or other costs (like sacrifices) to use the spell which is <Fork>ed. You get control over a complete copy but can change nothing except the targets.
2004/10/04: <Fork> does not let you make non-targeting choices about the spell.
2004/10/04: If the spell being copied targets a spell on the stack, it is possible to target <Fork> itself since <Fork> is still on the stack when you pick the target(s) for the copy. Note that the copy's target will be illegal when it resolves.
2004/10/04: If you copy a spell for which Buyback has been paid, you get nothing back since the copied spell does not have a card to give you.
2004/10/04: The copy that is placed on the stack is not considered to have been "cast".
2004/10/04: The <Fork> card goes to the graveyard when it resolves and leaves the copy on the stack. There is no card representing the copy on the stack.
2004/10/04: It does copy the mana symbols in the mana cost for the card it is copying, but it uses its own color definition and not the one from those mana symbols. This is so it maintains its color just like the text says.
2004/12/01: If you <Fork> a Spliced spell, the spliced text is added during the announcement of the original spell, and therefore is fully copied by <Fork>.
2009/05/01: The copy will have the same mana cost as the original spell, but will be red rather than whatever color that mana cost would have made it.
2009/10/01: If the targeted spell was kicked, then the copy will be kicked as well. If the targeted spell was not kicked, then the copy will not be kicked.</Rulings>

<CardText>{X}, {T}: Put a charge counter on Ice Cauldron and exile a nonland card from your hand. You may cast that card for as long as it remains exiled. Note the type and amount of mana spent to pay this activation cost. Activate this ability only if there are no charge counters on Ice Cauldron.
{T}, Remove a charge counter from Ice Cauldron: Add Ice Cauldron's last noted type and amount of mana. Spend this mana only to cast the last card exiled with Ice Cauldron.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Frazier</Artist>
<Multiverseid>202494</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The Cauldron counts only mana spent on it. It doesn't see the value of X, so isn't affected by cost reductions. Thus, if you spent {C}{C}{R}{R} on X, you get {C}{C}{R}{R} later even if X was 6.
2004/10/04: Cards which are not actually in your hand can't be exiled by the <Ice Cauldron>.
2004/10/04: If multiple cards are exiled by the Cauldron, the mana can only be used for the card that was exiled by the Cauldron when the most recent charge counter was put there.
2004/10/04: The mana put in the Cauldron can only be used to cast the given spell, but you can add additional mana to a spell. This means you can pay part of the cost on one turn and the rest of it on the next turn.
2004/10/04: You do not have to use any mana from the Cauldron when casting the spell if you don't want to. You don't even have to tap the Cauldron and draw the mana, you can just cast the spell using mana from somewhere else.
2004/10/04: If multiple cards are exiled by the Cauldron, any one of them can be cast.
2004/10/04: If the ability to exile a card with the Cauldron is countered, you do not lose the card since it is exiled during resolution.
2004/10/04: It is possible to have more than one card exiled by the Cauldron. You can tap the Cauldron to remove the charge counter and whatever mana is on it but leave the card there. Later, you can tap it and put in mana and a charge counter to add another card.
2004/10/04: X can be zero. This places a zero mana counter on the Cauldron.
2004/10/04: You can only cast the spell when you could legally cast it normally. So no casting a sorcery on your opponent's turn.
2004/10/04: The mana can be used to pay for additional costs to cast the spell.
2004/10/04: If the Cauldron leaves the battlefield, you can still cast any cards it exiled as though they were in your hand. You just no longer have access to the mana you charged the Cauldron with.
2004/10/04: Tapping the Cauldron for the mana is a mana ability.
2004/10/04: Produces mana of the last type used to put a counter on itself, not via any other charge counters.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If <Juggernaut> can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daniel Gelon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>202455</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: This effect has no effect on the cards being put into the graveyard from a library, because they are not "discarded".
2004/10/04: You can't use the <Library of Leng> ability to place a discarded card on top of your library when you discard a card as a cost, because costs aren't effects.
2004/10/04: The discard triggers anything else that triggers on discards.
2004/10/04: You can look at a randomly discarded card before deciding where it goes.
2004/10/04: The ability applies any time a spell or ability has you discard as part of its effect. It does not matter if you or your opponent control the spell or ability. The discard is forced because it is an effect.
2004/10/04: If more than one card is discarded due to a single effect, the Library allows you to decide whether or not to use it on each of the cards. You get to decide the order the cards are placed on the library if more than one goes there.
2004/10/04: Since the card goes directly to the library, the card is not revealed unless the spell or ability requiring the discard specifically says it is.
2004/10/04: The ability replaces the normal discard action with a discard action that puts the card on the library instead of the graveyard.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put <Library of Leng> onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>
