<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The decision to counter a spell or destroy a permanent is a decision made on announcement before the target is selected. If the spell is redirected, this mode can't be changed, so only targets of the selected type are valid.
2016/06/08: <Hydroblast> can target any spell or permanent, not just a red one. It checks the color of the target only on resolution.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mike Raabe</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The target of a spell that targets another spell on the stack can be changed to any other spell on the stack, even if the new target will resolve before the spell does.
2004/10/04: You can't make a spell which is on the stack target itself.
2004/10/04: You can choose to make a spell on the stack target this spell (if such a target choice would be legal had the spell been cast while this spell was on the stack). The new target for the deflected spell is not chosen until this spell resolves. This spell is still on the stack when new targets are selected for the spell.
2004/10/04: Once the spell resolves, the new target is considered to be targeted by the deflected spell. This will trigger any effects which trigger on being targeted.
2004/10/04: This does not check if the current target is legal. It just checks if the spell has a single target.
2004/10/04: You choose the spell to target on announcement, but you pick the new target for that spell on resolution.
2004/10/04: If there is no other legal target for the spell, this does not change the target.
2004/10/04: This only targets the spell being changed, not the original or new target of the spell it is affecting.
2009/02/01: If a spell targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Deflection>, even if all but one of those targets has become illegal.
2009/02/01: If a spell targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with <Deflection>.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Dance of the Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Dance of the Dead." Put enchanted creature card onto the battlefield tapped under your control and attach Dance of the Dead to it. When Dance of the Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.
At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, that player may pay {1}{B}. If the player does, untap that creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Randy Gallegos</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If more than one <Dance of the Dead> ends up on a creature, each contributes a +1/+1. But you only have to pay the untap cost once. You may pay for each one, however, and untap the card more than once during upkeep.
2008/04/01: This is a new wording. <Dance of the Dead> is now an Aura. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to that card again (since the card is treated as a new object on the battlefield).
2008/04/01: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Dance of the Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Dance of the Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Dance of the Dead> to another creature won't work.
2008/04/01: If the creature card put onto the battlefield has protection from black (or anything that prevents this from legally being attached), this won't be able to attach to it. Then this will go to the graveyard as a state-based action, causing the creature to be sacrificed.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christopher Rush</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: When creatures return to the battlefield, they are put onto the battlefield as if just cast. Creatures with X in the mana cost are treated as X is zero. Creatures which can pay costs when put onto the battlefield to determine abilities must have those costs paid at this time.
2004/10/04: Token creatures cease to exist when they leave the battlefield, so this effect just exiles them with no chance to bring them back like you can with cards.
2004/10/04: If changed to another land type, the creature cards are not lost but can't be released until the land reverts to normal.
2004/10/04: When the creature leaves the battlefield any damage or "will be destroyed at some future time" effects are removed from the creature.
2004/10/04: Auras on creatures are put into the graveyard and counters on creatures are removed when the creatures are sent to the Haven.
2004/10/04: Creatures return to the control of their owners, regardless of who controls the Haven when it is sacrificed.
2004/10/04: All cards in the Haven stay there even if they cease to be creatures. When the Haven is sacrificed, the cards come back onto the battlefield whether or not they are creatures.
2004/10/04: Creatures return to the battlefield simultaneously.</Rulings>

<CardText>This spell costs {1} more to cast for each target beyond the first.
Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among any number of targets.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: If the Bottle leaves the battlefield or your control, the cards remain waiting until played or until the beginning of your next upkeep. The card is in the "Exile" zone.
2004/10/04: The card is not part of your hand in any way. You can't be forced to discard it due to a discard from hand effect, and you can't discard it to pay a cost.
2004/10/04: To "play a card" is to either cast a spell or to put a land onto the battlefield using the main phase special action.
2008/08/01: If you do not play the card before your next upkeep, it remains exiled; you just lose the ability to play it.
2008/10/01: The exiled card is played using the normal timing rules for its card type, as well as any other applicable restrictions such as "Cast [this card] only during combat." For example, you can't play the card during an opponent's turn unless it's an instant or has flash. Similarly, if the exiled card is a land, you can't play it if you've already played a land that turn. If it's a nonland card, you'll have to pay its mana cost. The only thing that's different is you're playing it from the Exile zone.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/08/01: If another player takes control of the Factory while it is animated, that player keeps control until the control effect ends.

However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
