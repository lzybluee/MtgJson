2006/05/01: Any damage prevention or regeneration abilities must be activated before <Kindle the Carnage> starts resolving in order to have any effect. You can't wait to see which (if any) cards are discarded.
2006/05/01: A creature that's been dealt lethal damage by an iteration of this effect will remain on the battlefield and be dealt more damage by any further iterations. After you stop, all creatures that have been dealt lethal damage are put into their owners' graveyards at the same time.
2006/05/01: All the damage has the same source. However, each iteration of this process is a separate instance of damage. An effect that prevents damage the "next time" this card would deal it will prevent damage from only one iteration.
2006/05/01: A single regeneration shield is sufficient to save a particular creature, no matter how many instances of damage are on it.</Rulings>

If it's cast after combat damage is dealt, the Saproling will enter the battlefield blocking the attacking creature, but will neither deal combat damage to it nor be dealt combat damage by it.

<Rulings>2006/05/01: Only the creature that's becoming a copy is targeted. The creature that it will copy isn't chosen until <Cytoshape> resolves.
2006/05/01: The creature copies the printed values of the chosen creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature. It won't copy effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2006/05/01: If the creature copies a creature that's copying a creature, it will become whatever the chosen creature is copying.
2006/05/01: If the creature becomes a copy of a face-down creature, it will become a 2/2 creature with no name, creature type, abilities, mana cost, or color. It will not become face-down and thus can't be turned face up.
2006/05/01: This effect can cause the target to stop being a creature. For example, if it becomes a copy of an animated Blinkmoth Nexus, the printed wording will be copied and it will become an unanimated Blinkmoth Nexus.
2006/05/01: Effects that have already applied to the target creature will continue to apply to it. For example, if Giant Growth had given it +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then <Cytoshape> makes it a copy of Grizzly Bears, it will be a 5/5 Grizzly Bears.
2006/05/01: A creature may become a copy of itself this way. This generally won't have any visible effect.
2006/05/01: At the end of the turn, the creature reverts to what it was before. If two <Cytoshape>s affect the same creature on the same turn, they'll both wear off at the same time.</Rulings>
