<Artist>Chippy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>212626</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: If <Isochron Scepter> leaves the battlefield while the activated ability is on the stack, the ability can still make a copy.
2016/06/08: You cast the copy while the ability is resolving and still on the stack.
2016/06/08: If the imprinted card leaves the exile zone while the activated ability is on the stack, the copy can't be made.
2016/06/08: If the exiled card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
2016/06/08: If you don't want to cast the copy, you can choose not to; the copy ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked.
2016/06/08: Because you're already casting the spell using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. When you activate the second ability, you may choose to cast either half of the split card, but you may not cast both halves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Everything about the original spell is copied, including any decisions made on announcement, such as whether it was kicked or its Buyback cost was paid. Effects on the spell, such as Sleight of Mind or Flashback, are not copied.
2004/10/04: If the copied spell requires a target and there are no legal targets, then the copy has the same target (which should be illegal) as the original.
2004/10/04: If the spell is countered before the triggered ability resolves, then the ability will make a copy of how the spell looked right before it was countered.
2004/10/04: It triggers once per spell, so you can't get multiple copies of a spell using this card. And since this card is legendary, you can't control more than one.
2004/10/04: The copy is not "cast" so it will not trigger anything that triggers on a spell being cast.
2004/10/04: You choose whether or not to pay when the triggered ability resolves.
2004/10/04: You are not required to choose new targets. If you do choose, then the targets must be legal. If you don't change them, the spell is placed on the stack whether or not the targets are legal. The legality of the targets is always checked on resolution of the spell, so the spell may be countered at that time if all of its targets are illegal.</Rulings>
