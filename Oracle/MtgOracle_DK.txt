<Rulings>2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.
2004/10/04: The ability can be activated if the opponent has no lands that produce mana, but the effect will not be able to generate any mana.
2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Fellwar Stone> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: When creatures return to the battlefield, they are put onto the battlefield as if just cast. Creatures with X in the mana cost are treated as X is zero. Creatures which can pay costs when put onto the battlefield to determine abilities must have those costs paid at this time.
2004/10/04: Token creatures cease to exist when they leave the battlefield, so this effect just exiles them with no chance to bring them back like you can with cards.
2004/10/04: If changed to another land type, the creature cards are not lost but can't be released until the land reverts to normal.
2004/10/04: When the creature leaves the battlefield any damage or "will be destroyed at some future time" effects are removed from the creature.

<Type>Land</Type>
<CardText>{T}: Choose two target blocking creatures an opponent controls. If each of those creatures could block all creatures that the other is blocking, remove both of them from combat. Each one then blocks all creatures the other was blocking.
Whenever Sorrow's Path becomes tapped, it deals 2 damage to you and each creature you control.</CardText>
<Artist>Randy Asplund-Faith</Artist>
<Multiverseid>1826</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: This has two abilities. The second ability triggers any time it becomes tapped, whether to pay for its ability or not.
2009/10/01: When <Sorrow's Path>'s first ability is activated, its second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of the first ability. The second ability resolves first, and may cause some of the attacking creatures to be dealt lethal damage.
2009/10/01: The first ability can target any two blocking creatures a single opponent controls. Whether those creatures could block all creatures the other is blocking isn't determined until the ability resolves.
2009/10/01: A "blocking creature" is one that has been declared as a blocker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield blocking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be a blocking creature through the end of combat step, even if the creature or creatures that it was blocking are no longer on the battlefield or have otherwise left combat by then.
2009/10/01: Abilities that trigger whenever one of the targeted creatures blocks will trigger when the first ability resolves, because those creatures will change from not blocking (since they're removed from combat) to blocking. It doesn't matter if those abilities triggered when those creatures blocked the first time. Abilities that trigger whenever one of the attacking creatures becomes blocked will not trigger again, because they never stopped being blocked creatures. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature blocks one of the attacking creatures will trigger again, though; those kinds of abilities trigger once for each creature that blocks.
2009/10/01: When determining whether a creature could block all creatures the other is blocking, take into account evasion abilities (like flying), protection abilities, and other blocking restrictions, as well as abilities that allow a creature to block multiple creatures or block as though a certain condition were true. Take into account whether those creatures are tapped, but not whether they have costs to block (since those apply only as blockers are declared).
2009/10/01: When the first ability resolves, if all the creatures that one of the targeted creatures was blocking have left combat, then the other targeted creature is considered to be able to block all creatures the first creature is blocking. If the ability has its full effect, the second creature will be removed from combat but not returned to combat; it doesn't block anything.</Rulings>
