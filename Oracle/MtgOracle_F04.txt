<CardText>Morph {1}{U} (You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for {3}. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)
When Willbender is turned face up, change the target of target spell or ability with a single target.</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Peterson</Artist>
<Watermark>Fnm</Watermark>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The trigger occurs when you use the Morph ability to turn the card face up, or when an effect turns it face up. It will not trigger on being revealed or on leaving the battlefield.
2013/04/15: If a spell with split second is on the stack, you can still respond by turning this creature face up and targeting that spell with the trigger. This is because split second only stops players from casting spells or activating abilities, while turning a creature face up is a special action.
2018/03/16: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Willbender>'s triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s ability.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Brill</Artist>
<Watermark>Fnm</Watermark>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: If a card in a player's graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/12/07: The amount of life you lose is determined by the converted mana cost of the card in your graveyard, not the creature once it's on the battlefield.
2018/12/07: You lose life after the creature is already on the battlefield. Any abilities it has that interact with loss of life, such as that of Platinum Emperion, apply to that loss of life.
2018/12/07: If any abilities trigger on the creature entering the battlefield, those abilities resolve after you lose life. If losing life results in you losing the game, those abilities won't resolve.
2018/12/07: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the creature you control from <Reanimate> is exiled.</Rulings>
