<CardText>Electrolyze deals 2 damage divided as you choose among one or two targets.
Draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: You divide the damage as you cast <Electrolyze>, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. In other words, as you cast <Electrolyze>, you choose whether to have it deal 2 damage to a single target, or deal 1 damage to each of two targets.
2017/11/17: If <Electrolyze> targets two creatures and one becomes an illegal target, the remaining target is dealt 1 damage, not 2. You'll still draw a card.
2017/11/17: If all chosen targets are illegal as <Electrolyze> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt and you won't draw a card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: If a spell or ability causes you to draw multiple cards, Niv-Mizzet's ability triggers that many times.
2018/03/16: If dealing 1 damage to a permanent or player causes you to draw a card, perhaps because Niv-Mizzet is enchanted by Curiosity, you'll continue this loop until the loop is interrupted, perhaps by a player losing the game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/09/25: You can cast <Serra Avenger> during another player's first, second, or third turns of the game if some other effect (such as Vedalken Orrery) enables that.
2012/07/01: <Serra Avenger> cares about how many turns you have taken, not necessarily how many turns the game has had, in case you take an extra turn.
2012/07/01: If the game is restarted (by Karn Liberated), you can't cast <Serra Avenger> in your first, second, or third turn in the new game.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Zug</Artist>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: Doran's ability means, for example, that a 2/3 creature will assign 3 damage in combat instead of 2.
2007/10/01: Doran's ability doesn't actually change creatures' power; it changes only the value of the combat damage they assign. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values.
2007/10/01: This effect is mandatory and affects all creatures.</Rulings>

<CardText>Each other Warrior creature you control enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.
Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has trample.</CardText>
<Artist>Jim Murray</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If a Warrior would normally enter the battlefield with a certain number of +1/+1 counters on it, it enters the battlefield with that many +1/+1 counters plus one on it instead. If a Warrior would normally enter the battlefield with no +1/+1 counters on it, it enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it instead.
2008/04/01: The creature gets the counter if it would enter the battlefield under your control. It doesn't matter who owns the creature or what zone it enters the battlefield from (such as your opponent's graveyard, for example).
2008/04/01: The effects from more than one <Bramblewood Paragon> are cumulative. That is, if you have more than one <Bramblewood Paragon> on the battlefield, Warrior creatures you control enter the battlefield with that many additional +1/+1 counters on them.
2008/04/01: If <Bramblewood Paragon> enters the battlefield at the same time as another Warrior (due to Living End, for example), that creature doesn't get a +1/+1 counter.</Rulings>

2013/07/01: Examples of creature types include Sliver, Goblin, and Soldier. Creature types appear after the dash on the type line of creatures.</Rulings>
