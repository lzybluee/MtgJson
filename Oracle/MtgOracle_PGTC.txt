<CardText>Consuming Aberration's power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your opponents' graveyards.
Whenever you cast a spell, each opponent reveals cards from the top of their library until they reveal a land card, then puts those cards into their graveyard.</CardText>

<Rulings>2013/01/24: If any opponent has no land cards in their library, all the cards from that library will be revealed and put into their graveyard.
2013/01/24: The cards will be put into graveyards before the spell you cast to cause the ability to trigger resolves. However, none of those cards will be in a graveyard as you cast that spell, so they can't be chosen as a target of that spell.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>2GU (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Evolve (Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature has greater power or toughness than this creature, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)
Whenever a +1/+1 counter is put on Fathom Mage, you may draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Watermark>Simic</Watermark>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: If multiple +1/+1 counters are placed on <Fathom Mage> simultaneously, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.
2013/01/24: If <Fathom Mage> enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it (perhaps due to Master Biomancer), its last ability will trigger once for each +1/+1 counter it entered the battlefield with.
2013/01/24: <Fathom Mage>'s last ability will trigger whenever any +1/+1 counter is placed on it, not just ones due to the evolve ability.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: The three attacking creatures don't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker.
2013/04/15: Once a battalion ability has triggered, it doesn't matter how many creatures are still attacking when that ability resolves.

<Rulings>2013/04/15: You may pay {W/B} a maximum of one time for each extort triggered ability. You decide whether to pay when the ability resolves.
2013/04/15: The amount of life you gain from extort is based on the total amount of life lost, not necessarily the number of opponents you have. For example, if your opponent's life total can't change (perhaps because that player controls Platinum Emperion), you won't gain any life.
