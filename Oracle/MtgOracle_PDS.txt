<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Slivercycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Sliver card. After you find a Sliver card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Slivercycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Slivercycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Plainscycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Slivercycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Slivercycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Sliver creature type, even if it isn't a creature card. This includes, for example, Tribal cards with the Changeling ability. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Sliver card in your library.

<Rulings>2013/07/01: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like flying, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.
2013/07/01: If the creature type of a Sliver changes so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, you may search your library for a creature card with the same total power and toughness and put it onto the battlefield. If you do, shuffle your library.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Brill</Artist>
<Multiverseid>207929</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If you cast a 2/2 Grizzly Bears, for example, you may then search for any creature with total power and toughness 4. It can be 0/4, 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1.
2007/02/01: The game checks the power and toughness of the creature that just entered the battlefield as it exists on the battlefield. That might mean it's impossible to get another copy of that same card. For example, a Triskelion on the battlefield is 4/4, but a Triskelion in your library is 1/1. The power and toughness might also have been affected while the triggered ability was on the stack (such as with Giant Growth, Sudden Death, or Ovinize).
2007/02/01: If the creature that entered the battlefield has left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, use the power and toughness of that creature as it last appeared before leaving the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: This checks for lands you control with the land type Mountain or Forest, not for lands named Mountain or Forest. The lands it checks for don't have to be basic lands. For example, if you control Temple Garden (a nonbasic land with the land types Forest and Plains), <Rootbound Crag> will enter the battlefield untapped.
2009/10/01: As this is entering the battlefield, it checks for lands that are already on the battlefield. It won't see lands that are entering the battlefield at the same time (due to Warp World, for example).</Rulings>
