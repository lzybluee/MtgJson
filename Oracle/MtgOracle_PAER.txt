<Rulings>2017/02/09: After <Aethergeode Miner> returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the creature that was exiled. It won't be in combat or have any additional abilities it may have had when it was exiled. Any +1/+1 counters on it or Auras attached to it are removed, and any Equipment will no longer be attached.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.</Rulings>

They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If <Consulate Crackdown> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no artifacts will be exiled.
2017/02/09: Auras attached to the exiled artifacts will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any counters on the exiled artifacts will cease to exist.
2017/02/09: If an artifact token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.

If <Consulate Crackdown> exiles multiple artifacts, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
2017/02/09: In a multiplayer game, if <Consulate Crackdown>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

You choose whether <Exquisite Archangel> is moved to exile or to your graveyard.
2017/02/09: If an effect says that you can't lose the game, <Exquisite Archangel>'s effect doesn't apply.
2017/02/09: If you control two <Exquisite Archangel>s, you choose which one's effect applies. The other's effect won't be applicable after that until the next time you would lose the game.
2017/02/09: <Exquisite Archangel>'s effect applies any time you would lose the game, even if you're not losing due to your life total being 0 or less. If you would have lost the game because you tried to draw from an empty library, you won't lose again until you try to draw again and still can't do so.
2017/02/09: <Exquisite Archangel>'s effect does nothing if you concede the game. A player who concedes leaves the game.
2017/02/09: For your life total to become your starting life total (normally 20), you gain or lose the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is -4 when <Exquisite Archangel>'s ability applies, it will cause you to gain 24 life; alternatively, if your life total is 40 when it applies, it will cause you to lose 20 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2017/02/09: If an effect states that an opponent wins the game, <Exquisite Archangel>'s ability doesn't apply.
2017/02/09: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Exquisite Archangel>'s ability causes the team's life total to become the team's starting life total (normally 30), but only you actually gain or lose life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Any abilities that trigger on the token being created won't resolve until after <Mechanized Production>'s triggered ability has finished resolving entirely and performed its check for eight artifacts with the same name.
2017/02/09: The eight artifacts with the same name don't have to have the same name as the enchanted artifact. For example, you win the game if you control eight Thopter artifact creature tokens as <Mechanized Production>'s ability resolves, even if <Mechanized Production> isn't attached to a Thopter.
2017/02/09: All eight of the permanents sharing a name must be artifacts. If you control only seven artifacts with the same name and a nonartifact permanent with that same name, you won't win the game.
2017/02/09: If you control eight or more artifacts that share a name while you control <Mechanized Production>, you won't win the game yet. You'll win the game while resolving its triggered ability during your upkeep.
2017/02/09: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact and nothing else (unless that artifact is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that artifact is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, or so on.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact is copying something else (for example, if the copied artifact is a Sculpting Steel), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that artifact copied.
2017/02/09: If the copied artifact is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
2017/02/09: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact trigger when the artifact token enters the battlefield. The artifact token also has any "this enters the battlefield with" or "as this enters the battlefield" abilities that the copied artifact has.
2017/02/09: If <Mechanized Production> and the enchanted artifact leave the battlefield simultaneously in response to the triggered ability, then the effect creates a token that's a copy of the artifact as it last existed on the battlefield.
2017/02/09: If the enchanted artifact leaves the battlefield in response to <Mechanized Production>'s triggered ability but <Mechanized Production> does not, <Mechanized Production> is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action with no enchanted artifact. The triggered ability creates no token, but you can still win the game if you control enough artifacts with the same name.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christine Choi</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2017/02/09: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast <Whir of Invention> (a spell with improvise and mana cost {X}{U}{U}{U}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{U}{U}{U}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{U}{U}{U}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: If the target creature becomes an illegal target, <Battle at the Bridge> doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. You won't gain life.
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.

Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Whir of Invention (a spell with improvise and mana cost {X}{U}{U}{U}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{U}{U}{U}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{U}{U}{U}.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards.

<Artist>Greg Opalinski</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: The first triggered ability triggers both when <Glint-Sleeve Siphoner> enters the battlefield and whenever it attacks. You don't have to choose only one.
2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: Some triggered abilities state that you "may pay" a certain amount of {E}. You can't pay that amount multiple times to multiply the effect. You simply choose whether or not to pay that amount of {E} as the ability resolves, and no player may take actions to try to stop the ability's effect after you make your choice.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/02/09: If a creature's toughness is reduced to 0 or less by <Yahenni's Expertise>, that creature is still on the battlefield as you cast your free spell. It can be the target of that spell, although it will become an illegal target before that spell resolves. If it has any abilities that trigger on the spell being cast, those abilities will trigger.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.

2017/02/09: The target opponent chooses whether to have <Pia's Revolution> deal 3 damage to them as its ability resolves. You won't return the card to your hand if that player chooses to be dealt damage or if the card leaves the graveyard before the ability resolves.
2017/02/09: If there are no legal targets for <Pia's Revolution>'s ability (perhaps because each of your opponents has hexproof), it will be removed from the stack with no effect. No one may choose to be dealt damage and you won't return the artifact card to your hand.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. These cards have the Planeswalker symbol in their text box; this symbol has no effect on gameplay.

2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)

<Rulings>2017/02/09: If the revealed card is not a permanent card or if you choose not to put it onto the battlefield, you may put it on the bottom of your library. If you don't, it remains on top of your library.
2017/02/09: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2017/02/09: If a permanent put onto the battlefield this way has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your end step, it won't trigger during this end step.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: You may cast one of the cards drawn by <Rishkar's Expertise>'s first effect while performing its second effect.
2017/02/09: A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
2017/02/09: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/02/09: The greatest power among creatures you control is determined as <Rishkar's Expertise> resolves.
2017/02/09: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/02/09: While you're casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner's graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can't target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
2017/02/09: Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell's first effect won't be put onto the stack until after you're done casting your free spell. They're put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.
2017/02/09: Effects that allow you to "cast" a card don't allow you to play a land card.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If an expertise spell allows you to cast a split card, you may cast either half or, if that split card has fuse, both halves.</Rulings>

You still draw a card even if you can't return a card to your hand.

Then each opponent in the same order chooses a card in their hand without revealing it, then all chosen cards are discarded at the same time.

2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.
2017/02/09: multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever Gonti's Aether Heart or another artifact enters the battlefield under your control, you get {E}{E} (two energy counters).

<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.</Rulings>

Crew 3 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 3 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)
You may remove a loyalty counter from a planeswalker you control rather than pay Heart of Kiran's crew cost.</CardText>
<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: Paying <Heart of Kiran>'s alternative crew cost isn't a loyalty ability. It can be done even if you've already activated a loyalty ability of the planeswalker this turn, and it can be done any time you could activate <Heart of Kiran>'s crew ability.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.</Rulings>

2017/02/09: The target player (and any other player) may cast spells in response to the activated ability of <Hope of Ghirapur>. The ability won't affect those spells and it won't affect spells that the target player cast before you activated it. (In other words, the ability can't be used to counter a spell.)
2017/02/09: If you skip your turn, the affected player will be unable to cast noncreature spells until you actually start a turn.
2017/02/09: When a player leaves a multiplayer game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player's next turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.</Rulings>

<CardText>Nonartifact spells you cast have improvise. (Your artifacts can help cast those spells. Each artifact you tap after you're done activating mana abilities pays for {1}.)</CardText>
<Flavor>Ghirapur's most celebrated inventors have been immortalized in clockwork.</Flavor>
<Artist>Kirsten Zirngibl</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: Multiple instances of improvise are redundant.
2017/02/09: If you cast a nonartifact spell that requires you to sacrifice a permanent as an additional cost, you may tap that permanent (if it's an artifact) for the spell's improvise ability before you sacrifice it to pay that cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2017/02/09: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2017/02/09: Because improvise isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2017/02/09: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2017/02/09: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2017/02/09: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2017/02/09: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2017/02/09: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Whir of Invention (a spell with improvise and mana cost {X}{U}{U}{U}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{U}{U}{U}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{U}{U}{U}.</Rulings>
