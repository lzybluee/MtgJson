Miracle {W} (You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it's the first card you drew this turn.)</CardText>
<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425827</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.</Rulings>

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425829</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Entreat the Angels>'s converted mana cost is based on its mana cost of {X}{X}{W}{W}{W}, even if you're casting it for its miracle cost. For example, if you cast <Entreat the Angels> for its miracle cost and choose 4 for X, its converted mana cost is 11.
2017/03/14: A mana cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {6}{W}{W}{W} to cast <Entreat the Angels>.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.

<Artist>James Paick</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425851</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: Each player chooses the order that creatures they own are put onto the bottom of their library. This order isn't revealed to other players.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.
2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
2013/04/15: The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
2013/04/15: The new token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.

2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Noah Bradley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425926</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: Although <Mogg Flunkies> can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, <Mogg Flunkies> could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that <Mogg Flunkies> blocks.
2018/03/16: Once <Mogg Flunkies> has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
2018/03/16: If an effect says that <Mogg Flunkies> attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with <Mogg Flunkies> and that creature.
2018/03/16: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Mogg Flunkies> can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: If you cast an instant or sorcery with {X} in its mana cost this way, you still choose the value of X as part of casting the spell and pay that cost.
2017/03/14: If an instant or sorcery card in your graveyard already has flashback, you may use either flashback ability to cast it from your graveyard.

<Artist>Lucas Graciano</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425931</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s last ability triggers only once for each time combat damage is dealt, no matter how many creatures are dealing damage at that time.
2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability can trigger during each combat damage step. For example, if a creature with first strike deals combat damage, you can return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand and discard it using its bloodrush ability to pump up an attacking creature without first strike. Then, when that creature deals combat damage, you can return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand again.
2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s last ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard when the creatures deal combat damage to a player. It returns to your hand only if it's still in your graveyard when the ability resolves. Notably, if <Pyrewild Shaman> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability won't trigger.
2017/03/14: If creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at the same time (perhaps because it's a multiplayer game), <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability will trigger once for each of those players. However, only the first such ability that you pay for will return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand. Even if it's put back into your graveyard before the other abilities resolve, it's considered a different <Pyrewild Shaman> than the one whose ability triggered.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has the same name as a card in your graveyard, you may put a quest counter on Pyromancer Ascension.
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell while Pyromancer Ascension has two or more quest counters on it, you may copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425933</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: If either of <Pyromancer Ascension>'s abilities triggers, it will go on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve first. If it's <Pyromancer Ascension>'s second ability that triggered, the copy it creates will also resolve before the original spell. The copy is created even if the original spell has been countered.
2017/03/14: If <Pyromancer Ascension>'s first ability triggers, you'll put a quest counter on it even if the card in your graveyard leaves your graveyard by the time the ability resolves or if the spell you cast is countered.
2017/03/14: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your graveyard (due to an ability such as flashback, for example), <Pyromancer Ascension>'s first ability won't trigger unless another card with the same name is in your graveyard.
2017/03/14: The second ability triggers only if <Pyromancer Ascension> already has two quest counters on it at the time you cast an instant or sorcery spell. This means a spell can't cause the second counter to be put on <Pyromancer Ascension> and then become copied. It also means a player can't remove <Pyromancer Ascension> in response to you casting an instant or sorcery spell in order to prevent the ability from triggering.
2017/03/14: <Pyromancer Ascension>'s second ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2017/03/14: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2017/03/14: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/03/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/03/14: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.
2017/03/14: <Scourge Devil>'s triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves, including <Scourge Devil> itself. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: You can choose any creature token you control for populate. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers' Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
2013/04/15: If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.
2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425983</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Cruel Ultimatum>'s only target is an opponent. You don't choose which creature card in your graveyard you'll return to your hand until <Cruel Ultimatum> resolves.
2017/03/14: All of the actions for <Cruel Ultimatum> are performed sequentially, in the order listed. Earlier actions may affect how you perform later actions. For example, if the opponent sacrifices a creature that they control but you own, it will end up in your graveyard. When <Cruel Ultimatum> lets you return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, you can choose that one.
2017/03/14: If, as <Cruel Ultimatum> begins to resolve, your opponent's life total is 5 or less and you have two or fewer cards in your library, the game will result in a draw. Your opponent's life total will drop to 0 or less, but <Cruel Ultimatum> must finish resolving completely before state-based actions are performed. You'll then be forced to draw three cards and fail to draw one. When state-based actions are finally performed, you and your opponent will both lose the game at the same time, which means the game is a draw.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/03/14: When resolving Domri's first ability, if the card you look at isn't a creature card, or if it's a creature card you don't want to put into your hand, you simply put it back on top of your library. You don't reveal it or say why you're putting it back.
2017/03/14: The second target of Domri's second ability can be another creature you control, but it can't be the same creature as the first target.
2017/03/14: If either target of Domri's second ability is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.
2017/03/14: If a creature has both double strike and trample, the combat damage it assigned during the first combat damage step will be considered when determining how much damage can trample through in the second combat damage step. If each creature blocking it is destroyed during the first combat damage step, then all of the damage must be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker during the second combat damage step.</Rulings>

<Artist>Greg Staples</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425987</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Evil Twin> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below) and it gains the activated ability. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: The activated ability that <Evil Twin> gains as part of its copy effect is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Evil Twin>), then your <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is a token, <Evil Twin> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Evil Twin> is not a token in this case.
2017/03/14: Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named "Beast."
2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2017/03/14: If <Evil Twin> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Evil Twin> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2017/03/14: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/03/14: You choose how many targets <Fiery Justice> has and how the damage is divided as you cast it. Each target for its damage-dealing effect must receive at least 1 damage.
2017/03/14: If some (but not all) of the targets become illegal, the original division of damage still applies, but no damage is dealt to illegal targets. If all targets become illegal, including the target opponent for the life-gaining effect, <Fiery Justice> doesn't resolve. If each target for the damage-dealing effect becomes illegal while the target for the life-gaining effect remains legal, that player gains 5 life even though no damage is dealt.
2017/03/14: The target opponent for the life-gaining effect may also be a target for the damage-dealing effect. If this happens and the damage brings that player's life total to 0 or less, the life-gaining effect will raise their life total above 0 again before the player would lose the game.</Rulings>

Unearth {1}{B} ({1}{B}: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step or if it would leave the battlefield. Unearth only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Cole Eastburn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426006</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2017/03/14: The set of creatures that gets +1/+0 from an overloaded <Teleportal> is determined as the spell resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0. However, because the second part of <Teleportal>'s effect doesn't change the characteristics of any permanents, the set of creatures that can't be blocked is constantly updated.

<Rulings>2017/03/14: If a spell gains a second instance of conspire from Wort's ability, you may choose to pay for one, both, or none of those abilities. Each conspire ability triggers only if you tap two creatures specifically for that ability.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/03/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/03/14: Some spells instruct you to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast that spell. If you sacrifice Wort to pay that cost, that spell won't have conspire at the moment it becomes cast, so conspire won't trigger, even if you tapped two creatures.
2017/03/14: If you're casting a spell for its flashback cost, you can't pay another alternative cost (such as an overload cost or a Trap's alternative cost) instead. You may pay additional costs, such as conspire.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Human or Warrior. Card types such as artifact can't be chosen.
2018/12/07: The spell can't be countered if the mana produced by <Cavern of Souls> is spent to cover any cost of the spell, even an additional cost such as a kicker cost. This is true even if you use the mana to pay an additional cost while casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."</Rulings>
