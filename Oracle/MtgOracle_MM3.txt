<Rulings>2013/04/15: You can choose any creature token you control for populate. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers' Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
2013/04/15: The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
2013/04/15: The new token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.
2013/04/15: If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>425886</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: <Bonfire of the Damned>'s converted mana cost is based on its mana cost of {X}{X}{R}, even if you're casting it for its miracle cost. For example, if you cast <Bonfire of the Damned> for its miracle cost and choose 4 for X, its converted mana cost is 9.

Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, if Pyrewild Shaman is in your graveyard, you may pay {3}. If you do, return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Lucas Graciano</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425931</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s last ability triggers only once for each time combat damage is dealt, no matter how many creatures are dealing damage at that time.
2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability can trigger during each combat damage step. For example, if a creature with first strike deals combat damage, you can return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand and discard it using its bloodrush ability to pump up an attacking creature without first strike. Then, when that creature deals combat damage, you can return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand again.
2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s last ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard when the creatures deal combat damage to a player. It returns to your hand only if it's still in your graveyard when the ability resolves. Notably, if <Pyrewild Shaman> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability won't trigger.
2017/03/14: If creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at the same time (perhaps because it's a multiplayer game), <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability will trigger once for each of those players. However, only the first such ability that you pay for will return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand. Even if it's put back into your graveyard before the other abilities resolve, it's considered a different <Pyrewild Shaman> than the one whose ability triggered.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has the same name as a card in your graveyard, you may put a quest counter on Pyromancer Ascension.
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell while Pyromancer Ascension has two or more quest counters on it, you may copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425933</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: If either of <Pyromancer Ascension>'s abilities triggers, it will go on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve first. If it's <Pyromancer Ascension>'s second ability that triggered, the copy it creates will also resolve before the original spell. The copy is created even if the original spell has been countered.
2017/03/14: If <Pyromancer Ascension>'s first ability triggers, you'll put a quest counter on it even if the card in your graveyard leaves your graveyard by the time the ability resolves or if the spell you cast is countered.
2017/03/14: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your graveyard (due to an ability such as flashback, for example), <Pyromancer Ascension>'s first ability won't trigger unless another card with the same name is in your graveyard.
2017/03/14: The second ability triggers only if <Pyromancer Ascension> already has two quest counters on it at the time you cast an instant or sorcery spell. This means a spell can't cause the second counter to be put on <Pyromancer Ascension> and then become copied. It also means a player can't remove <Pyromancer Ascension> in response to you casting an instant or sorcery spell in order to prevent the ability from triggering.
2017/03/14: <Pyromancer Ascension>'s second ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2017/03/14: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2017/03/14: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/03/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/03/14: You can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Artist>Dave Kendall</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425936</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.
2017/03/14: <Scourge Devil>'s triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves, including <Scourge Devil> itself. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0.</Rulings>

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>425983</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Cruel Ultimatum>'s only target is an opponent. You don't choose which creature card in your graveyard you'll return to your hand until <Cruel Ultimatum> resolves.
2017/03/14: All of the actions for <Cruel Ultimatum> are performed sequentially, in the order listed. Earlier actions may affect how you perform later actions. For example, if the opponent sacrifices a creature that they control but you own, it will end up in your graveyard. When <Cruel Ultimatum> lets you return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, you can choose that one.
2017/03/14: If, as <Cruel Ultimatum> begins to resolve, your opponent's life total is 5 or less and you have two or fewer cards in your library, the game will result in a draw. Your opponent's life total will drop to 0 or less, but <Cruel Ultimatum> must finish resolving completely before state-based actions are performed. You'll then be forced to draw three cards and fail to draw one. When state-based actions are finally performed, you and your opponent will both lose the game at the same time, which means the game is a draw.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: A token permanent returned to a player's hand isn't a card and can't be discarded. It will cease to exist when state-based actions are performed after the ability finishes resolving.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: If either target of Domri's second ability is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.
2017/03/14: If a creature has both double strike and trample, the combat damage it assigned during the first combat damage step will be considered when determining how much damage can trample through in the second combat damage step. If each creature blocking it is destroyed during the first combat damage step, then all of the damage must be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker during the second combat damage step.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Evil Twin> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below) and it gains the activated ability. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: The activated ability that <Evil Twin> gains as part of its copy effect is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Evil Twin>), then your <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is a token, <Evil Twin> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Evil Twin> is not a token in this case.
2017/03/14: Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named "Beast."
2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2017/03/14: If <Evil Twin> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Evil Twin> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2017/03/14: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

If all targets become illegal, including the target opponent for the life-gaining effect, <Fiery Justice> doesn't resolve. If each target for the damage-dealing effect becomes illegal while the target for the life-gaining effect remains legal, that player gains 5 life even though no damage is dealt.
2017/03/14: The target opponent for the life-gaining effect may also be a target for the damage-dealing effect. If this happens and the damage brings that player's life total to 0 or less, the life-gaining effect will raise their life total above 0 again before the player would lose the game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Scott M. Fischer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426018</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.
2017/03/14: The set of creatures that gets +1/+0 from an overloaded <Teleportal> is determined as the spell resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0. However, because the second part of <Teleportal>'s effect doesn't change the characteristics of any permanents, the set of creatures that can't be blocked is constantly updated. Any creature you control at the moment blockers are chosen can't be blocked.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eytan Zana</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426023</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Urban Evolution>'s effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you don't get to play a land as <Urban Evolution> resolves; <Urban Evolution> fully resolves first and draws three cards, perhaps including a land you'll play later.
2017/03/14: The effects of multiple <Urban Evolution>s in the same turn are cumulative. They're also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Explore.
2017/03/14: If you somehow manage to cast <Urban Evolution> when it's not your turn, you'll draw three cards when it resolves, but you won't be able to play a land that turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Rebekah Lynn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426024</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Vanish into Memory> cares about the creature's power just before it left the battlefield and its toughness just after it returns to the battlefield. For example, if you target a 2/2 creature with two +1/+1 counters on it, you'll draw four cards, then when it returns to the battlefield without any counters on it, you'll discard two cards.
2017/03/14: If the creature exiled with <Vanish into Memory> never returns to the battlefield (because it was a token creature, for example), you don't discard any cards.
2017/03/14: If the creature exiled with <Vanish into Memory> isn't a creature card (for example, a crewed Vehicle), that card will still be returned to the battlefield, but not as a creature. Since the card returned to the battlefield has no toughness, you discard no cards.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: You can choose any creature token you control for populate. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers' Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
2013/04/15: The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
2013/04/15: The new token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.
2013/04/15: If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.
2017/03/14: The ability that defines <Wayfaring Temple>'s power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
2017/03/14: As long as <Wayfaring Temple> is on the battlefield, its first ability will count itself, so it'll be at least 1/1.</Rulings>

<Artist>David Palumbo</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426036</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: You can choose any creature token you control for populate. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers' Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
2013/04/15: The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
2013/04/15: The new token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.
2013/04/15: If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.
2017/03/14: You must target an artifact or enchantment to cast <Sundering Growth>. If that artifact or enchantment is an illegal target when <Sundering Growth> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't populate.</Rulings>

2016/06/08: If this spell is copied, the copy will not have had any colors of mana paid for it, no matter what colors were spent on the original spell.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Wort, the Raidmother enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 red and green Goblin Warrior creature tokens.
Each red or green instant or sorcery spell you cast has conspire. (As you cast the spell, you may tap two untapped creatures you control that share a color with it. When you do, copy it and you may choose new targets for the copy.)</CardText>
<Artist>Dave Allsop</Artist>
<Multiverseid>426039</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: If a spell gains a second instance of conspire from Wort's ability, you may choose to pay for one, both, or none of those abilities. Each conspire ability triggers only if you tap two creatures specifically for that ability.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/03/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/03/14: Some spells instruct you to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast that spell. If you sacrifice Wort to pay that cost, that spell won't have conspire at the moment it becomes cast, so conspire won't trigger, even if you tapped two creatures.
2017/03/14: If you're casting a spell for its flashback cost, you can't pay another alternative cost (such as an overload cost or a Trap's alternative cost) instead. You may pay additional costs, such as conspire.</Rulings>
