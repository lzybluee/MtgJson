<Rulings>2019/07/12: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time <Aerial Assault> tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't gain life. If the target is legal but is not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you will gain life.
2019/07/12: Any abilities that trigger as the target creature is destroyed won't resolve until after you've gained life.

<Rulings>2019/07/12: If a planeswalker you control is also a creature (most likely because it's Gideon), it will be counted twice as Ajani's first ability resolves.
2019/07/12: The tokens created by Ajani's second ability are similar to the card Ajani's Pridemate, but they have no mana cost and their converted mana cost is 0.
2019/07/12: If Ajani's Pridemate is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2019/07/12: The ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers only once.
2019/07/12: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Ajani's Pridemate's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/07/12: Whether you have at least 15 life more than your starting life total is determined as Ajani's last ability resolves.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause Ajani's Pridemate's ability to trigger, even though it will cause your team's life total to increase.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Ajani's last ability exiles permanents as long as your team's life total is greater than your team's starting life total by 15 or more life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/07/12: If you control two Angels of Vitality and you would gain life, you gain that much life plus 2. A third <Angel of Vitality> has you gain that much life plus 3, and so on.
2019/07/12: The middle ability of <Angel of Vitality> applies just once to each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Angel of Vitality> applies only once.

However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will apply only once.
2019/07/12: If <Angel of Vitality> is dealt damage and your life total is increased above 25 before state-based actions are performed (most likely because <Angel of Vitality> is dealt combat damage at the same time that a creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage), <Angel of Vitality>'s last ability applies before checking whether it's destroyed for having lethal damage marked on it.
2019/07/12: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to <Angel of Vitality> may become lethal if your life total drops below 25 during that turn.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause <Angel of Vitality>'s second ability to apply, even though it will cause your team's life total to increase.
2019/07/12: In multiplayer formats where your life total doesn't start at 20, <Angel of Vitality>'s last ability still applies if your life total is 25 or more.

An Aura returning to the battlefield this way doesn't target the player or permanent it will enchant, so permanents or players with hexproof may be chosen; however, the chosen recipient must be able to legally be enchanted by the Aura, so a player or permanent with protection from one of the Aura's qualities can't be chosen this way. If there's nothing legal for the Aura to enchant, it stays in the graveyard.

<Rulings>2016/06/08: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. Then the first turn begins.</Rulings>

<Artist>Nicholas Gregory</Artist>
<Multiverseid>466781</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: You can activate <Loxodon Lifechanter>'s last ability after it has entered the battlefield but before its first ability has resolved.
2019/07/12: You choose whether to change your life total and, if you choose to do so, you set your life total to the appropriate number while <Loxodon Lifechanter>'s triggered ability is resolving. No player may take any actions between the time you choose to set your life total and the time your life total changes.
2019/07/12: For your life total to become a certain number, you gain or lose the corresponding amount of life. For example, if your life total is 4 when the ability resolves and your creatures have a total of 6 toughness, the ability will cause you to gain 2 life; alternatively, if your life total is 10 when the ability resolves, it will cause you to lose 4 life if you choose to change your life total. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2019/07/12: If you set your life total to become equal to the toughness of creatures you control, this happens once. If the toughness of your creatures changes later, it won't affect your life total.
2019/07/12: The value of X is determined only as <Loxodon Lifechanter>'s last ability begins to resolve. It won't change later in the turn if your life total changes.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/07/12: If you control more than one <Loyal Pegasus>, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
2019/07/12: Although <Loyal Pegasus> can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, <Loyal Pegasus> could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that <Loyal Pegasus> blocks.
2019/07/12: Once <Loyal Pegasus> has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
2019/07/12: If an effect says that <Loyal Pegasus> attacks or blocks "if able," and you control one or more other creatures that are able to attack or block, you must attack or block with <Loyal Pegasus> and at least one other creature.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Loyal Pegasus> can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.</Rulings>

If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Bloodthirsty Aerialist> triggers only once.
2019/07/12: If <Bloodthirsty Aerialist> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2019/07/12: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Bloodthirsty Aerialist>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. Then the first turn begins.
2019/07/12: While <Leyline of the Void> is on the battlefield, nontoken creatures your opponents control won't die. They'll be exiled instead. Abilities that would trigger when those creatures die won't trigger.
2019/07/12: Tokens still die while <Leyline of the Void> is on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/07/12: Combat damage is the damage that's dealt automatically by attacking and blocking creatures. Any other damage is noncombat damage, even if it's dealt during a combat phase by an attacking or blocking creature.
2019/07/12: The last ability of <Chandra's Spitfire> triggers just once for each event in which an opponent is dealt noncombat damage, regardless of how much damage that player is dealt.
2019/07/12: In a multiplayer game, if a source deals damage to multiple opponents at the same time, the last ability of <Chandra's Spitfire> will trigger as many times as there are opponents who were dealt damage.</Rulings>

2019/07/12: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2019/07/12: If the spell or ability that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copies will have the same value of X.
2019/07/12: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copies too.
2019/07/12: The copies made by <Repeated Reverberation>'s ability are created on the stack, so they're not "cast" or "activated." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activate an ability don't trigger.

<Rulings>2019/07/12: If the target land is an illegal target by the time <Tectonic Rift> tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. Creatures without flying will be able to block as normal. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), creatures without flying will be unable to block.
2019/07/12: Because it doesn't modify the characteristics of creatures, <Tectonic Rift> can affect creatures that enter the battlefield or lose flying after the spell resolves, and it will stop affecting creatures that gain flying.</Rulings>

<Artist>Yongjae Choi</Artist>
<Multiverseid>466916</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: The target card must have lesser toughness both as <Thunderkin Awakener> attacks and as its triggered ability resolves. Other abilities that trigger whenever <Thunderkin Awakener> attacks can't raise its toughness in time to allow the ability to target cards with greater toughness.
2019/07/12: If <Thunderkin Awakener> leaves the battlefield after it has attacked but before its triggered ability resolves, use its toughness as it last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the card is still a legal target.
2019/07/12: You choose which player or planeswalker the returned creature is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that <Thunderkin Awakener> is attacking.
2019/07/12: Although the returned creature is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks (such as that of <Thunderkin Awakener> itself) won't trigger when it enters the battlefield attacking.
2019/07/12: If the new creature leaves the battlefield before the end step, that card remains in its current zone. It won't be sacrificed.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mathias Kollros</Artist>
<Multiverseid>466926</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Gargos). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/07/12: Gargos's cost-reduction ability affects only generic mana in a Hydra's cost. For example, if you cast a Hydra spell with mana cost {2}{G}{G}{G}, it will cost {G}{G}{G} to cast, not {G}.
2019/07/12: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you choose the value for X before applying cost reductions. For example, if you cast a Hydra spell with mana cost {X}{G}{G} and choose for X to be 6, you pay {2}{G}{G}. Any of that Hydra's abilities that refer to X still uses 6 as the value for X regardless of what you actually paid.
2019/07/12: Gargos's cost-reduction ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. Gargos doesn't reduce its own cost.
2019/07/12: Gargos's controller chooses which creature (if any) Gargos will fight, not the controller of the spell.
2019/07/12: If a spell targets one creature you control multiple times, Gargos's ability triggers once. If that spell targets multiple creatures you control, Gargos's ability triggers once for each of those creatures.
2019/07/12: Gargos's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2019/07/12: If the target creature is an illegal target when Gargos's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. If Gargos is no longer on the battlefield, the target creature won't deal or be dealt damage.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>466970</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: The number of Elementals you control is counted as Omnath's first ability resolves. If Omnath is still on the battlefield, it will count itself.
2019/07/12: You may choose Omnath as the target of its own second ability.
2019/07/12: If the target Elemental is an illegal target by the time Omnath's second ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card if you control eight or more lands. If the target is legal but can't have a +1/+1 counter put on it (most likely because an opponent controls Blightbeetle), you do draw a card if you control eight or more lands.</Rulings>

If a permanent entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.</CardText>
<Flavor>"Yarok grieves within the waste
Of Bala Ged's corrupted land."
—Lament for Bala Ged, stanza 1</Flavor>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>466974</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: Yarok affects a permanent's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that permanent enters the battlefield. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
2019/07/12: Replacement effects are unaffected by Yarok's ability. For example, a creature that enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.
2019/07/12: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a color with Diamond Knight, are also unaffected.
2019/07/12: You don't need to control the permanent entering the battlefield, only the permanent that has the triggered ability.
2019/07/12: Yarok's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.
2019/07/12: If you somehow control two Yaroks, a permanent entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Yarok causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
2019/07/12: If a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Yarok (including Yarok itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2019/07/12: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.
2019/07/12: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>

2019/07/12: The target creature has only the colors <Scuttlemutt> gives it—<Scuttlemutt>'s ability overwrites any previous colors the creature had.
2019/07/12: In the Commander variant, the color identities of cards are determined as the game begins. Changing the colors of a player's commander doesn't affect its color identity or the cards that can be legally included in the deck.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>467001</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: If you control multiple lands with the same name, only one of those lands will count toward the seven or more required to create a Zombie. For example, if you control four lands named Plains, two named Island, and one named <Field of the Dead>, you control three lands with different names.
2019/07/12: <Field of the Dead>'s last ability counts itself and the land entering the battlefield in addition to whichever other lands you control.
2019/07/12: If multiple lands enter the battlefield simultaneously, possibly including <Field of the Dead> itself, all of those lands are counted. For example, if you sacrifice eight lands while resolving Scapeshift and search your library for five different basic land cards, two <Field of the Dead> cards, and one other land card with a different name, you'll create sixteen Zombie tokens.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Twinblade Paladin.
As long as you have 25 or more life, Twinblade Paladin has double strike. (It deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jana Schirmer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>469838</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/07/12: The first ability of <Twinblade Paladin> triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Twinblade Paladin> triggers only once.
2019/07/12: If <Twinblade Paladin> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2019/07/12: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Twinblade Paladin>'s first ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/07/12: If you're dealt first-strike combat damage that brings your life total below 25, <Twinblade Paladin> will immediately lose double strike. It won't deal regular combat damage unless you bring your life total back above 25 before the regular combat damage step.
2019/07/12: If <Twinblade Paladin> gains double strike after combat damage has already been dealt (most likely because a creature with lifelink dealt combat damage), <Twinblade Paladin> will deal only regular combat damage.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the first ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Twinblade Paladin> has double strike as long as your team has 25 or more life.</Rulings>
