<Rulings>2017/11/17: Each of the chosen modes happens sequentially. If a permanent has an ability that triggers whenever it or another permanent is destroyed, it will see permanents destroyed at the same time as it or before it, but not permanents destroyed by later modes.
2017/11/17: If the first and third modes are chosen, an artifact creature with converted mana cost 3 or less will have to be regenerated twice to survive. This is because the modes happen sequentially, and the regeneration "shield" is used up by the first one. (A similar thing happens with most of the other combinations.)
2017/11/17: If a card is exiled "until" another permanent leaves the battlefield, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after that permanent leaves the battlefield during <Austere Command>'s resolution, and it may be destroyed by a later mode.</Rulings>

If an opponent would search a library, that player searches the top four cards of that library instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Jose Cabrera</Artist>
<Multiverseid>429861</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: Each search works exactly the same as normal except that the opponent doing the searching sees only the top four cards of that library. They can't look at the other cards in that library at all. Cards not in the top four cards of the library can't be found in the search, even if they're identifiable in some manner.
2017/04/18: For effects that check whether a player searched a library, searching the top four cards of that library counts as searching that library.
2017/04/18: If an effect uses the word "search" once but allows an opponent to search for multiple cards, the top four cards remain the same throughout the entire search. Finding one card won't cause the fifth card to be included in the search.
2017/04/18: After the search is complete, the entire library is shuffled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: <Containment Priest>'s last ability won't affect any creatures that were cast, including ones cast from unusual zones such as your graveyard.
2018/12/07: <Containment Priest>'s last ability doesn't stop creature tokens from entering the battlefield. It also doesn't affect creatures that were already on the battlefield.
2018/12/07: If a noncreature card wasn't cast and is entering the battlefield as a creature (due to an effect such as that of March of the Machines), it will be exiled. Similarly, if a creature card wasn't cast and is entering the battlefield as a noncreature permanent (for example, Heliod, God of the Sun with insufficient devotion), it won't be exiled.
2018/12/07: If <Containment Priest> enters the battlefield without being cast, its ability won't exile itself.
2018/12/07: If <Containment Priest> enters the battlefield at the same time as other creatures, its ability won't affect those creatures.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/07/15: If an opponent casts a spell with X in its mana cost, the converted mana cost of that spell takes the value of X into account. If you reveal a card with X in its mana cost, X is 0. For example, if your opponent casts Blaze with X=1, <Counterbalance> will counter that spell if you reveal a card with converted mana cost 2, but it won't counter that spell if you reveal a Blaze of your own.
2017/04/18: If an opponent casts half of a split card (for example, Hit), it won't be countered if you reveal that same split card. The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves, but the converted mana cost of Hit is determined using only that half's mana cost.</Rulings>

2018/12/07: <Maelstrom Pulse> has only one target. Other permanents with the same name will be destroyed even if they have hexproof or protection.
2018/12/07: If the target permanent becomes an illegal target for <Maelstrom Pulse>, the spell doesn't resolve. Nothing is destroyed.
2018/12/07: The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types it was created with unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 red Elemental creature token created by Young Pyromancer and a 4/4 green Elemental creature token created by Walker of the Grove are both named "Elemental."
2018/12/07: If <Maelstrom Pulse> resolves but the target permanent isn't destroyed (perhaps because it regenerates or has indestructible), all other permanents with the same name as it will still be destroyed.</Rulings>

<Artist>Grzegorz Rutkowski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430688</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: The number of Zombies you control is counted as <The Scarab God>'s first ability resolves. Players can try to change that number in response to the ability (perhaps by activating its second ability).
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics it specifically modifies. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into its owner's graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie instead of its other types (unlike Zombies created by an eternalize ability) and is black instead of its other colors. Its power and toughness are 4/4. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: Unlike the tokens created by an eternalize ability, this token has the mana cost and thus converted mana cost of the card it's copying.
2017/07/14: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.
2017/07/14: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <The Scarab God>'s first ability causes the opposing team to lose life equal to twice the number of Zombies you control, although you scry only equal to the number of Zombies you control.
2017/07/14: If this creature dies but leaves your graveyard before the next end step, it will remain in its new zone.
2017/07/14: The "next end step" refers to the next end step that occurs, not the end step of the next turn. If this creature dies before a turn's end step (for example, during combat), it will be returned to its owner's hand at the beginning of that turn's end step.</Rulings>
