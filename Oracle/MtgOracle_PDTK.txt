<Rulings>2015/02/25: Bolster itself doesn't target any creature, though some spells and abilities that bolster may have other effects that target creatures. For example, you could put counters on a creature with protection from white with Aven Tactician's bolster ability.
2015/02/25: You determine which creature to put counters on as the spell or ability that instructs you to bolster resolves. That could be the creature with the bolster ability, if it's still under your control and has the least toughness.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Watermark>Ojutai</Watermark>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: If there are no creature cards in the library, it will be revealed and shuffled. The target creature will remain exiled.
2015/02/25: Casting the card again due to the delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
2015/02/25: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (either because another spell or ability counters it or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.
2015/02/25: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2015/02/25: As long as you cast a spell with rebound from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost or an alternative cost you were permitted to pay.
2015/02/25: If you cast a spell with rebound from any zone other than your hand (including your opponent's hand), rebound will have no effect.
2015/02/25: If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2015/02/25: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2015/02/25: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

2018/12/07: If <Living Lore> leaves the battlefield, the ability that defines its power and toughness will lose track of the exiled card. Its power and toughness are 0 in other zones.
2018/12/07: Similarly, if the exiled card somehow leaves exile while <Living Lore> is on the battlefield, it will become a 0/0 creature.
2018/12/07: <Living Lore>'s last ability will trigger whenever it deals combat damage, no matter if that damage is dealt to an opponent, an opposing planeswalker, or a creature it's blocking or being blocked by. You choose whether to sacrifice <Living Lore> as that ability resolves. If <Living Lore> has already left the battlefield, perhaps because it was dealt lethal damage at the same time it dealt damage, you can't sacrifice it.
2018/12/07: You may cast a sorcery this way even if it's not your turn.
2018/12/07: If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
2018/12/07: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.

Dash {1}{R} (You may cast this spell for its dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and it's returned from the battlefield to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>
<Watermark>Kolaghan</Watermark>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: Once <Zurgo Bellstriker> has legally blocked a creature, raising that creature's power to 2 or greater won't undo the block.
2015/02/25: Even though both cards portray the same character, <Zurgo Bellstriker> and Zurgo Helmsmasher have different names. Controlling both of them won't invoke the "legend rule."
2015/02/25: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2015/02/25: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2015/02/25: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
2015/02/25: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.</Rulings>

<Artist>Viktor Titov</Artist>
<Watermark>Atarka</Watermark>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: You compare <Den Protector>'s power to the power of any creature trying to block it only as blockers are assigned. Once <Den Protector> has been legally blocked by a creature, changing the power of either creature won't change or undo the block.
2015/02/25: Turning a face-down creature with megamorph face up and putting a +1/+1 counter on it is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/02/25: If a face-down creature with megamorph is turned face up some other way (for example, if you manifest a card with megamorph and then pay its mana cost to turn it face up), you won't put a +1/+1 counter on it.
2015/02/25: Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. You can find more information on morph on cards with morph from the Khans of Tarkir set.</Rulings>

Scaleguard Sentinels enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it if you revealed a Dragon card or controlled a Dragon as you cast this spell.</CardText>
<Artist>David Gaillet</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: If one of these spells is copied, the controller of the copy will get the "Dragon bonus" only if a Dragon card was revealed as an additional cost. The copy wasn't cast, so whether you controlled a Dragon won't matter.
2015/02/25: You can't reveal more than one Dragon card to multiply the bonus. There is also no additional benefit for both revealing a Dragon card as an additional cost and controlling a Dragon as you cast the spell.
2015/02/25: If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus. For example, if you lose control of your only Dragon while casting the spell (because, for example, you sacrificed it to activate a mana ability), you won't get the bonus.</Rulings>

<Watermark>Atarka</Watermark>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.
2015/02/25: Some formidable abilities are activated abilities that require creatures you control to have total power 8 or greater. Once you activate these abilities, it doesn't matter what happens to the total power of creatures you control.
2015/02/25: Other formidable abilities are triggered abilities with an "intervening 'if'" clause. Such abilities check the total power of creatures you control twice: once at the appropriate time to see if the ability will trigger, and again as the ability tries to resolve. If, at that time, the total power of creatures you control is no longer 8 or greater, the ability will have no effect.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/02/25: You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren't chosen. For example, you can cast Ojutai's Command without targeting a creature spell provided you don't choose the third mode.
2015/02/25: As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of Ojutai's Command, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won't matter in most cases.)

<Rulings>2015/02/25: You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/02/25: You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren't chosen. For example, you can cast <Ojutai's Command> without targeting a creature spell provided you don't choose the third mode.
2015/02/25: As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of <Ojutai's Command>, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won't matter in most cases.)
2015/02/25: If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets for the copy, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/02/25: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>
