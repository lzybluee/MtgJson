<Rulings>2013/09/15: Numeric mana symbols ({0}, {1}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2013/09/15: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2013/09/15: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2013/09/15: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2014/02/01: <Acolyte's Reward> has two targets: the creature that would be dealt damage and the permanent or player that <Acolyte's Reward> will deal damage to. These targets are chosen as you cast <Acolyte's Reward>.
2014/02/01: The amount of damage the prevention shield will prevent is based on your devotion to white as <Acolyte's Reward> resolves. That amount won't change later in the turn, even if your devotion to white does.
2014/02/01: You don't choose a source of damage. The prevention shield will apply to the next X damage that would be dealt to the first target, no matter where that damage comes from. It also doesn't matter whether the damage is dealt at the same time. For example, if the shield prevents the next 5 damage to the first target, and that creature would be dealt 3 damage by Lightning Strike, that 3 damage is prevented and <Acolyte's Reward> deals 3 damage to the second target. The prevention effect will still apply to the next 2 damage the first target would be dealt that turn.
2014/02/01: The effect of <Acolyte's Reward> isn't a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, <Acolyte's Reward> (not the source of that damage) deals damage to the second target as part of that prevention effect. <Acolyte's Reward> is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color or whether it had lifelink) don't apply. The new damage isn't combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
2014/02/01: As <Acolyte's Reward> tries to resolve, if only the first target is illegal, <Acolyte's Reward> won't prevent any damage that would be dealt to that creature and, because of this, <Acolyte's Reward> won't deal damage to the second target. If only the second target is illegal, damage that would be dealt to the first target will be prevented, but <Acolyte's Reward> won't deal damage. If both targets are illegal, <Acolyte's Reward> won't resolve.
2014/02/01: After <Acolyte's Reward> resolves, it no longer matters whether either target is still legal. For example, if the second target is a creature controlled by an opponent, and it gains hexproof after <Acolyte's Reward> resolves but before it prevents damage, <Acolyte's Reward> will still deal damage to that creature. If <Acolyte's Reward> can't deal damage to the second target (perhaps because it's a creature that has left the battlefield), <Acolyte's Reward> will still prevent damage; it just won't deal any damage itself.
2014/02/01: If <Acolyte's Reward> prevents damage, it deals its damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens before state-based actions are performed, and before any player can cast spells or activate abilities. If the source of the original damage was a spell or ability, this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.
2014/02/01: If the amount of damage that would be dealt to the first target is in excess of the amount of damage that <Acolyte's Reward> would prevent, the source deals its excess damage to the first target at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then <Acolyte's Reward> deals its damage.
2014/02/01: The damage will be dealt by <Acolyte's Reward> as it existed on the stack, not as it exists when the damage is dealt. That is, it's an instant spell that's dealing the damage, in case an ability cares about that (such as Satyr Firedancer's, which includes the phrase "Whenever an instant or sorcery spell you control deals damage to an opponent").
2014/02/01: If the first target would be dealt combat damage by multiple creatures, you choose which of that damage to prevent. (For example, if one of those creatures has deathtouch, you could choose to prevent the damage from that creature specifically.) You don't decide until the point at which the creatures would deal their damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: The Archetype's second ability applies to each creature controlled by any of your opponents, no matter when it entered the battlefield.
2014/02/01: While you control an Archetype, continuous effects generated by the resolution of spells and abilities that would give the specified ability to creatures your opponents control aren't created. For example, if you control <Archetype of Courage>, a spell cast by an opponent that gives creatures they control first strike wouldn't cause the creatures to have first strike, even if later in the turn <Archetype of Courage> left the battlefield. (If the spell has additional effects, such as raising the power of the creatures, those effects will apply as normal.)
2014/02/01: Conversely, continuous effects generated by static abilities (such as an Aura that granted the appropriate ability) would resume applying if the Archetype left the battlefield.
2014/02/01: If you and an opponent each control the same Archetype, no creature controlled by any player will have the appropriate ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/02/01: <Eidolon of Countless Battles>'s last ability functions only on the battlefield. In other zones, it is a 0/0 enchantment creature card.
2014/02/01: A permanent with bestow is either a creature or an Aura, not both (although it's an enchantment either way). It will contribute just +1/+1 toward the bonus given by <Eidolon of Countless Battles>.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: <Loyal Pegasus> can be declared as an attacker only if another creature is declared as an attacker at the same time. Similarly, <Loyal Pegasus> can be declared as a blocker only if another creature is declared as a blocker at the same time.
2014/02/01: If you control more than one <Loyal Pegasus>, they can both attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
2014/02/01: Although <Loyal Pegasus> can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, <Loyal Pegasus> could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
2014/02/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game (or in another format using the shared team turns option), <Loyal Pegasus> can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Artist>Clint Cearley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>378395</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: If the opponent pays tribute, the creature will enter the battlefield with the specified number of +1/+1 counters on it. It won't enter the battlefield and then have the +1/+1 counters placed on it.
2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
2014/02/01: If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.
2014/02/01: Players can't respond to the tribute decision before the creature enters the battlefield. That is, if the opponent doesn't pay tribute, the triggered ability will trigger before any player has a chance to remove the creature.
2014/02/01: The triggered ability will resolve even if the creature with tribute isn't on the battlefield at that time.
2017/04/18: For effects that check which player put counters on the entering creature, the player chosen to pay tribute puts those counters on it, not the creature's controller.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>378420</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: You may exchange control of <Perplexing Chimera> and any spell cast by an opponent, not just one with targets.
2014/02/01: You make the decision whether to exchange control of <Perplexing Chimera> and the spell as the triggered ability resolves.
2014/02/01: If <Perplexing Chimera> leaves the battlefield or the spell leaves the stack before the triggered ability resolves, you can't make the exchange.
2014/02/01: Neither <Perplexing Chimera> nor the spell changes zones. Only control of them is exchanged.
2014/02/01: After the ability resolves, you control the spell. Any instance of "you" in that spell's text now refers to you, "an opponent" refers to one of your opponents, and so on. The change of control happens before new targets are chosen, so any targeting restrictions such as "target opponent" or "target creature you control" are now made in reference to you, not the spell's original controller. You may change those targets to be legal in reference to you, or, if those are the spell's only targets, the spell will doesn't resolve for having illegal targets. When the spell resolves, any illegal targets are unaffected by it and you make all decisions the spell's effect calls for.
2014/02/01: You may change any of the spell's targets. If you change a target, you must choose a legal target for the spell. If you can't, you must leave the target the same (even if that target is now illegal).
2014/02/01: Gaining control of a spell and changing its targets won't cause any heroic abilities of the new targets to trigger.
2014/02/01: If you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell, it will be put into its owner's graveyard as it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered.
2014/02/01: In some unusual cases, you may not control <Perplexing Chimera> when its triggered ability resolves (perhaps because the triggered ability triggered again and resolved while the original ability was on the stack). In these cases, you can exchange control of <Perplexing Chimera> and the spell that causes the ability to trigger, even if you control neither of them. If you do, you'll be able to change targets of the spell, not the spell's new controller.</Rulings>

2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
2014/02/01: If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.
2014/02/01: Players can't respond to the tribute decision before the creature enters the battlefield. That is, if the opponent doesn't pay tribute, the triggered ability will trigger before any player has a chance to remove the creature.

<Rulings>2014/02/01: The Archetype's second ability applies to each creature controlled by any of your opponents, no matter when it entered the battlefield.
2014/02/01: While you control an Archetype, continuous effects generated by the resolution of spells and abilities that would give the specified ability to creatures your opponents control aren't created. For example, if you control Archetype of Courage, a spell cast by an opponent that gives creatures they control first strike wouldn't cause the creatures to have first strike, even if later in the turn Archetype of Courage left the battlefield. (If the spell has additional effects, such as raising the power of the creatures, those effects will apply as normal.)
2014/02/01: Conversely, continuous effects generated by static abilities (such as an Aura that granted the appropriate ability) would resume applying if the Archetype left the battlefield.
2014/02/01: If you and an opponent each control the same Archetype, no creature controlled by any player will have the appropriate ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/02/01: The triggered ability that causes you to lose life applies whether <Herald of Torment> is a creature or an Aura. The "you" in that ability refers to <Herald of Torment>'s controller. If you control <Herald of Torment> as an Aura enchanting a creature another player controls, that ability will trigger at the beginning of your upkeep and cause you to lose 1 life.</Rulings>

2013/09/15: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2014/02/01: Your devotion to black is calculated when you determine <Marshmist Titan>'s total cost, and that cost is locked in before any costs are paid. For example, if you control a creature with black mana symbols in its mana cost that can be sacrificed for mana, those mana symbols will count toward your devotion to black. You can then sacrifice that creature for mana to pay the reduced total cost.

<Multiverseid>378455</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: The opponent you target with the triggered ability doesn't have to be the same opponent you chose to pay tribute or not.
2014/02/01: If the opponent pays tribute, the creature will enter the battlefield with the specified number of +1/+1 counters on it. It won't enter the battlefield and then have the +1/+1 counters placed on it.
2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
2014/02/01: If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.
2014/02/01: Players can't respond to the tribute decision before the creature enters the battlefield. That is, if the opponent doesn't pay tribute, the triggered ability will trigger before any player has a chance to remove the creature.
2014/02/01: The triggered ability will resolve even if the creature with tribute isn't on the battlefield at that time.
2017/04/18: For effects that check which player put counters on the entering creature, the player chosen to pay tribute puts those counters on it, not the creature's controller.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>378456</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

For example, if you control Archetype of Courage, a spell cast by an opponent that gives creatures they control first strike wouldn't cause the creatures to have first strike, even if later in the turn Archetype of Courage left the battlefield. (If the spell has additional effects, such as raising the power of the creatures, those effects will apply as normal.)
2014/02/01: Conversely, continuous effects generated by static abilities (such as an Aura that granted the appropriate ability) would resume applying if the Archetype left the battlefield.

2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
2014/02/01: If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.

<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>378474</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: If you want to cast a card this way, you cast it as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as sorcery) are ignored. Other casting restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only before attackers are declared") are not.
2014/02/01: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
2014/02/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can, however, pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/02/01: If you choose to cast a split card with fuse without paying its mana cost, you may cast both halves.
2014/02/01: If the opponent pays tribute, the creature will enter the battlefield with the specified number of +1/+1 counters on it. It won't enter the battlefield and then have the +1/+1 counters placed on it.
2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell.

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player.

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: Numeric mana symbols ({0}, {1}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.

2013/09/15: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2013/09/15: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2013/09/15: The type-changing ability that can make the God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color.
2013/09/15: If a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not, for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2013/09/15: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and all creature subtypes. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2013/09/15: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2013/09/15: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat.
2013/09/15: If a God is dealt damage, then stops being a creature, then becomes a creature again later in the same turn, the damage will still be marked on it. This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)
2014/02/01: Ephara's last ability checks at the beginning of each upkeep whether another creature entered the battlefield under your control last turn. If one did, it will trigger; otherwise, it won't. The ability will trigger only once no matter how many creatures entered the battlefield under your control that turn, as long as at least one did.
2014/02/01: The last ability will trigger regardless of what has happened to the creature that entered the battlefield on the previous turn. It doesn't matter whether it's still under your control or whether it's still on the battlefield.
2014/02/01: If a noncreature permanent you control (such as an Aura with bestow) becomes a creature, it will not cause Ephara's last ability to trigger the following turn. This is true even if that noncreature permanent became a creature the same turn it entered the battlefield.</Rulings>

<CardText>Minotaur spells you cast cost {B}{R} less to cast. This effect reduces only the amount of colored mana you pay. (For example, if you cast a Minotaur spell with mana cost {2}{R}, it costs {2} to cast.)</CardText>
<Artist>Karl Kopinski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>378525</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: If you control more than one <Ragemonger>, the cost reduction is cumulative.
2014/02/01: You apply cost reduction effects after other cost modifiers, so <Ragemonger> can reduce additional costs or alternative costs of Minotaur spells if they include {B} and/or {R}.
2014/02/01: If a spell has hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost, you choose which half you will be paying before determining the total cost. If you choose to pay such a cost with {B} or {R}, <Ragemonger> can reduce that part of the cost.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: Inspired abilities trigger no matter how the creature becomes untapped: by the turn-based action at the beginning of the untap step or by a spell or ability.
2014/02/01: If an inspired ability triggers during your untap step, the ability will be put on the stack at the beginning of your upkeep. If the ability creates one or more token creatures, those creatures won't be able to attack that turn (unless they gain haste).
2014/02/01: Inspired abilities don't trigger when the creature enters the battlefield.
2014/02/01: If the inspired ability includes an optional cost, you decide whether to pay that cost as the ability resolves. You can do this even if the creature leaves the battlefield in response to the ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: Numeric mana symbols ({0}, {1}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2013/09/15: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2013/09/15: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).
2013/09/15: If an activated ability or triggered ability has an effect that depends on your devotion to a color, you count the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents you control as the ability resolves. The permanent with that ability will be counted if it's still on the battlefield at that time.
2013/09/15: The type-changing ability that can make the God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color.
2013/09/15: If a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not, for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2013/09/15: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and all creature subtypes. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2013/09/15: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2013/09/15: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat.
2013/09/15: If a God is dealt damage, then stops being a creature, then becomes a creature again later in the same turn, the damage will still be marked on it. This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)
2014/02/01: The value of X is calculated only once, as the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: The bonus given by <Heroes' Podium> counts only legendary creatures. It won't count itself unless some other effect causes it to be a creature in addition to being a land (in which case it will also get the bonus).
2014/02/01: <Heroes' Podium> will give a bonus to each legendary creature you control, even if gaining control of one causes the "legend rule" to apply. For example, if you control Brimaz, King of Oreskos (a 3/4 legendary creature), and gain control of another one, they'll each be 4/5 when you put one into its owner's graveyard. Then the remaining one will return to being 3/4.</Rulings>
