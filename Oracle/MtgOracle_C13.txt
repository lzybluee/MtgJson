<Rulings>2019/05/03: The ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Ajani's Welcome or 2 life from Battlefield Promotion.

2019/05/03: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Ajani's Pridemate>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/05/03: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers only once.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

2013/10/17: However, <Darksteel Mutation> does not overwrite effects that change the enchanted creature's power or toughness without setting it to a specific value (such as the ones created by Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem). It also won't overwrite the effect of counters.
2013/10/17: The enchanted creature will be only an artifact and a creature, not any other card types. It will be only an Insect, not any other creature types.
2013/10/17: In some rare cases, the creature may have subtypes other than creature types before becoming enchanted with <Darksteel Mutation>. If it had any other artifact subtypes (such as Equipment), it will retain those. If it had any subtypes other than artifact types and creature types (such as Shrine), it won't retain those.
2013/10/17: The creature will keep any supertypes it previously had. Notably, if <Darksteel Mutation> is enchanting a legendary creature, that creature will continue to be legendary. Also, if it's enchanting a commander, that creature will continue to be a commander.
2013/10/17: <Darksteel Mutation> doesn't affect the enchanted creature's colors, if any. It will continue to be whatever color or colors it was before <Darksteel Mutation> entered the battlefield.
2013/10/17: <Darksteel Mutation> causes the enchanted creature to lose all abilities except indestructible at the time it becomes enchanted. Any abilities the creature gains after that point will work normally.</Rulings>

Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Scott Chou</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376532</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, anything that cares about your life total checks the life total of your team. For example, say that your team has 10 life and your opponent's team has 11 life when you cast <Survival Cache>. You'll gain 2 life, so your team's life total becomes 12. Since your life total (12) is greater than an opponent's life total (11), you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.
2010/06/15: <Echo Mage>'s last two activated abilities can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2010/06/15: When either ability resolves, it creates a copy (or two) of a spell. The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. Each copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. Each copy resolves before the original spell does.
2010/06/15: Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2010/06/15: If you activate <Echo Mage>'s last ability to copy a spell twice, you may choose new targets for each copy independently. They don't have to have the same targets as one another. Be sure to specify which of the copies will resolve first.
2010/06/15: If the spell the ability copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), each copy will have the same mode as the original spell. You can't choose a different one.
2010/06/15: If the spell the ability copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), each copy has the same value of X as the original spell.
2010/06/15: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for a copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for each copy too.
2010/06/15: If a copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of that copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if a copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of that copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/10/17: Your opponents decide in turn order whether or not they accept the offer, starting with the opponent on your left. Each opponent will know the decisions of previous opponents in turn order when making their decision.
2013/10/17: After each opponent has decided, the effect happens simultaneously for each one who accepted the offer. Then, the effect happens again for you a number of times equal to the number of opponents who accepted.
2013/10/17: If the creature you control is an illegal target when <Tempt with Reflections> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No copies will be created.
2013/10/17: If the target creature has an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, the abilities of all the copies will trigger as <Tempt with Reflections> resolves. All of those abilities will be put on the stack after <Tempt with Reflections> finishes resolving. Abilities controlled by the active player will be put on the stack first (in an order of their choice), followed by abilities controlled by each other player in turn order. The last ability to be put on the stack will resolve first, and so on.
2013/10/17: The tokens copy exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). They don't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/10/17: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
2013/10/17: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the tokens enter the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2013/10/17: If the copied creature is a token, the tokens created by <Tempt with Reflections> copy the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
2013/10/17: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.</Rulings>

<Artist>Heather Hudson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376307</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: This can lower the cost to zero, but not below zero.

Suspend 5—{1}{B} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{B} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Carl Critchlow</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376445</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If the creature's power is less than 0, use its actual value to determine the total life loss. However, if this total is 0 or less, no life is lost. For example, if <Phthisis> destroys a -2/3 creature, its controller would lose 1 life. If it destroys a -4/3 creature, its controller would lose no life.</Rulings>

2006/09/25: If a face-down creature is affected by <Sudden Spoiling>, it won't be able to be turned face up for its morph cost. If some other effect turns it face up, it will remain a 0/2 creature with no abilities until the turn ends. Its "When this creature turns face up" or "As this creature turns face up" abilities won't work.
2006/09/25: <Sudden Spoiling> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, you can't cast this fast enough to stop a creature's "At the beginning of your upkeep" or "When this creature enters the battlefield" abilities from triggering.
2013/06/07: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from activating mana abilities.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent triggered abilities from triggering. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from performing special actions. Notably, players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
2013/06/07: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.

2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The ability checks that creature's power only once: when that creature enters the battlefield. The trigger checks a creature's initial power upon being put on the battlefield, so it will take into account counters that it enters the battlefield with and static abilities that may give it a continuous power boost once it's on the battlefield (such as the one on Glorious Anthem). After the creature is already on the battlefield, boosting its power with a spell (such as Giant Growth), activated ability, or triggered ability won't allow this ability to trigger; it's too late by then. Once the ability triggers, it will resolve no matter what the creature's power may become while the ability is on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376588</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Wild Ricochet> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2013/07/01: When <Wild Ricochet> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. The controller of the original spell retains control of that spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2013/07/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Volcanic Geyser does), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/07/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Wild Ricochet>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/07/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2013/10/17: Abilities that trigger whenever a player gains life can't trigger and effects that would replace gaining life with another effect won't apply because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2013/10/17: If an effect sets a player's life total to a specific number and that number is higher than the player's current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than the player's current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2013/10/17: To choose a target at random, all possible legal targets must have an equal chance of being chosen. There are many ways to do this, including assigning each possible legal target a number and rolling a die.
2013/10/17: The target is chosen at random as you put the last ability on the stack. Players can respond to this ability knowing who the target is.
2013/10/17: If you control <Witch Hunt>, you are not a legal target. If there are no legal targets available, the ability is removed from the stack and you retain control of <Witch Hunt>.</Rulings>

It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2009/10/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

2013/06/07: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.

2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

Evoke {4}{G} (You may cast this spell for its evoke cost. If you do, it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield.)</CardText>
<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376578</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: All of the actions for <Cruel Ultimatum> are performed sequentially, in the order listed. Earlier actions may affect how you perform later actions. For example, if the opponent sacrifices a creature that they control but you own, it will end up in your graveyard. When <Cruel Ultimatum> lets you return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, you can choose that one.
2017/03/14: If, as <Cruel Ultimatum> begins to resolve, your opponent's life total is 5 or less and you have two or fewer cards in your library, the game will result in a draw. Your opponent's life total will drop to 0 or less, but <Cruel Ultimatum> must finish resolving completely before state-based actions are performed. You'll then be forced to draw three cards and fail to draw one. When state-based actions are finally performed, you and your opponent will both lose the game at the same time, which means the game is a draw.</Rulings>

<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376382</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/10/17: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. However, you can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2013/10/17: If Jeleva leaves the battlefield, the exiled cards will remain exiled indefinitely. If Jeleva enters the battlefield again, it won't be associated with the cards the "other" Jeleva exiled. The new Jeleva will exile a new set of cards. Only those cards can be cast using Jeleva's last ability.
2013/10/17: The card is cast before blocking creatures are declared.

2013/10/17: If you cast an instant or sorcery card using Jeleva's last ability, you do so while that ability is resolving. If you choose not to (or you can't), you won't get a chance to cast it later unless the ability triggers again.
2013/10/17: When casting an instant or sorcery card this way, ignore all timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2014/02/01: The amount of mana you spent to cast this creature is usually equal to its converted mana cost. However, you also include any additional costs you pay, including the cost imposed for casting your commander from the command zone.
2014/02/01: You can't choose to pay extra mana to cast a creature spell unless something instructs you to.
2014/02/01: If Jeleva enters the battlefield without being cast, then no mana was spent to cast it. This means X will be 0, so no cards will be exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/10/17: You announce the value of X as you activate the ability, and all instances of X in the activation cost are equal to the announced value. For example, if you choose 2 as the value of X, then you pay {2} and remove two +1/+1 counters to pay the cost.
2014/02/01: The amount of mana you spent to cast this creature is usually equal to its converted mana cost. However, you also include any additional costs you pay, including the cost imposed for casting your commander from the command zone.
2014/02/01: You can't choose to pay extra mana to cast a creature spell unless something instructs you to.
2014/02/01: If Marath enters the battlefield without being cast, then no mana was spent to cast it. It will therefore enter the battlefield without any +1/+1 counters. If no other effects are increasing its toughness at that time, it will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2015/01/19: <Marath, Will of the Wild> is banned as a commander in Duel Commander format, but it may be part of your deck.</Rulings>

<Artist>Scott M. Fischer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>376432</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/10/01: <Nivix Guildmage>'s second ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2012/10/01: When the second ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/10/01: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2012/10/01: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Sphinx's Revelation does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/10/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you copy a spell that you cast by paying its overload cost, the copy will resolve as though its overload cost had been paid as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/10/17: If Oloro is your commander, its last ability will trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step on your first turn.
2013/10/17: Oloro's second ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life is gained.
2013/10/17: You decide whether to pay {1} as the second ability resolves. If you do, you'll draw a card and each opponent will lose 1 life.
2013/10/17: Oloro's first ability works only if Oloro is on the battlefield.
2013/10/17: In some unusual cases, you can gain life even though your life total actually decreases. For example, if you are being attacked by two 3/3 creatures and you block one with a 2/2 creature with lifelink, your life total will decrease by 1 even though you've gained 2 life. Oloro's second ability would trigger.
2013/10/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.
2013/10/17: If two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Oloro's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.

<Multiverseid>376566</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a land card of the specified land type, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/05/01: Landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/05/01: You can choose to find any card with the appropriate land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a land card with the appropriate type in your library.
2009/05/01: A landcycling ability lets you search for any card in your library with the stated land type. It doesn't have to be a basic land.
2009/05/01: You may only activate one landcycling ability at a time. You must specify which landcycling ability you are activating as you cycle this card, not as the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2010/03/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.
2010/03/01: You choose whether to pay {2} as the ability resolves. You may pay {2} only once per resolution.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: <Springjack Pasture>'s last ability is a mana ability. The whole ability — including the life gain — doesn't use the stack and therefore can't be responded to.
2008/08/01: If you sacrifice no Goats, you'll add no mana and you'll gain no life.
2008/08/01: You can sacrifice any Goats you control to activate the third ability, not just Goats created by <Springjack Pasture>.</Rulings>
