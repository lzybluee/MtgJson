<Rulings>2008/08/01: None of these abilities has a duration. If one of them resolves, it will remain in effect until the game ends, <Figure of Destiny> leaves the battlefield, or some subsequent effect changes its characteristics, whichever comes first.
2008/08/01: <Figure of Destiny>'s abilities overwrite its power, toughness, and creature types. Typically, those abilities are activated in the order they appear on the card. However, if <Figure of Destiny> is an 8/8 Kithkin Spirit Warrior Avatar with flying and first strike, and you activate its first ability, it will become a 2/2 Kithkin Spirit that still has flying and first strike.
2008/08/01: You can activate <Figure of Destiny>'s second and third abilities regardless of what creature types it is. Each of those abilities checks <Figure of Destiny>'s creature types when that ability resolves. If <Figure of Destiny> isn't the appropriate creature type at that time, the ability does nothing.
2008/08/01: <Figure of Destiny>'s second ability checks whether it's a Spirit, and its third ability checks whether it's a Warrior. It doesn't matter how it became the appropriate creature type.
2009/10/01: The effect from the ability overwrites other effects that set power and/or toughness if and only if those effects existed before the ability resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves. Effects that switch the creature's power and toughness are always applied after any other power or toughness changing effects, including this one, regardless of the order in which they are created.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>234702</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Fire Servant>'s ability applies no matter who or what the damage would be dealt to: a creature, a player, or a planeswalker.
2010/08/15: If a red instant or sorcery spell you control causes damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Lightning Bolt says "Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target." Such a spell is affected by <Fire Servant>'s ability. If the source of the damage is something else (for example, if the spell is Soul's Fire, which says "Target creature you control on the battlefield deals damage equal to its power to any target"), it isn't affected by <Fire Servant>'s ability.
2010/08/15: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the permanent that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn" and Lava Axe is a red sorcery that says "Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker." Suppose a Lava Axe controlled by a player who controls <Fire Servant> would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let <Fire Servant>'s effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
2010/08/15: If a red instant or sorcery spell you control divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Fireball does), the damage is divided before <Fire Servant>'s effect doubles it.
2010/08/15: If you control more than one <Fire Servant>, the effects are cumulative. Two such effects will cause damage from red instant or sorcery spells you control to be multiplied by four; three such effects will cause damage from red instant or sorcery spells you control to be multiplied by eight.</Rulings>

<Artist>jD</Artist>
<Multiverseid>234705</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: <Reverberate> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2010/08/15: When <Reverberate> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2010/08/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2010/08/15: If the spell <Reverberate> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2010/08/15: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Reverberate>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2010/08/15: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.</Rulings>
