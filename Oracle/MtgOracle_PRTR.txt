Whenever Archon of the Triumvirate attacks, detain up to two target nonland permanents your opponents control. (Until your next turn, those permanents can't attack or block and their activated abilities can't be activated.)</CardText>
<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Watermark>Azorius</Watermark>
<Rulings>2012/10/01: The nonland permanents will be detained before blockers are chosen. Notably, a creature detained this way can't block before it is detained.
2012/10/01: The two nonland permanents can be controlled by the same opponent or by different opponents.
2013/04/15: When a player leaves a multiplayer game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player's next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.
2013/04/15: If a permanent's activated ability is on the stack when that permanent is detained, the ability will be unaffected.
2013/04/15: If a noncreature permanent is detained and later turns into a creature, it won't be able to attack or block.
2013/04/15: Activated abilities include a colon and are written in the form "[cost]: [effect]." No one can activate any activated abilities, including mana abilities, of a detained permanent.
2013/04/15: The static abilities of a detained permanent still apply. The triggered abilities of a detained permanent can still trigger.
2013/04/15: If a creature is already attacking or blocking when it's detained, it won't be removed from combat. It will continue to attack or block.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: You make the choice to have the creature with unleash enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter or not as it's entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late for a player to respond to the creature spell by trying to counter it, for example.
2013/04/15: The unleash ability applies no matter where the creature is entering the battlefield from.
2013/04/15: A creature with unleash can't block if it has any +1/+1 counter on it, not just one put on it by the unleash ability.
2013/04/15: Putting a +1/+1 counter on a creature with unleash that's already blocking won't remove it from combat. It will continue to block.</Rulings>

<CardText>Trample
Cryptborn Horror enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the total life lost by your opponents this turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Nils Hamm</Artist>
<Rulings>2012/10/01: Remember, damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life (unless the source has infect).
2012/10/01: If no opponent has lost life on the turn <Cryptborn Horror> enters the battlefield, it will enter with no +1/+1 counters on it and be put into its owner's graveyard (unless something else is raising its toughness).
2012/10/01: <Cryptborn Horror> cares about the total life lost, not necessarily what an opponent's life total is compared to what it was at the beginning of the turn. For example, if an opponent loses 5 life and then gains 10 life on the turn <Cryptborn Horror> enters the battlefield, it will enter with five +1/+1 counters on it.
2012/10/01: In multiplayer games, life lost the turn <Cryptborn Horror> enters the battlefield by opponents who left the game later that turn will count toward the value of X.</Rulings>

<CardText>If an instant or sorcery card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Rulings>2012/10/01: If an instant or sorcery spell destroys <Dryad Militant> directly (like Murder does), that instant or sorcery card will be put into its owner's graveyard. However, if an instant or sorcery card deals lethal damage to <Dryad Militant>, <Dryad Militant> will remain on the battlefield until the next time state-based actions are checked, which is after the instant or sorcery finishes resolving. The instant or sorcery will be exiled.
2012/10/01: If an instant or sorcery card is discarded while <Dryad Militant> is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.</Rulings>
