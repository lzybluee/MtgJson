<Rulings>2019/05/03: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text, such as equip. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Karn.
2019/05/03: Karn's first ability affects only artifacts on the battlefield. Activated abilities that work in other zones can still be activated.
2019/05/03: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2019/05/03: If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2019/05/03: Karn's last ability can't get a face-down card in exile, even if you know it's an artifact card.
2019/05/03: In a casual game, a card you choose from outside the game comes from your personal collection. In a tournament event, a card you choose from outside the game must come from your sideboard. You may look at your sideboard at any time.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>460929</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Ugin). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/05/03: A colorless spell whose mana cost is {2} or {1} will cost {0} to cast.
2019/05/03: Once you look at the exiled face-down card once, you may look at it again any time you wish. If another player gains control of the Spirit token, that player can't look at the exiled card.
2019/05/03: If the Spirit leaves the battlefield for any reason, you'll put the exiled card into your hand, even if Ugin left the battlefield before that happened.
2019/05/03: If you've activated Ugin's ability multiple times, you must keep track of which exiled card belongs to each Spirit token.
2019/05/03: If an effect such as that of Doubling Season causes Ugin to create two Spirit tokens, you still only exile one card from your library. You'll put that card into your hand the first time that either of the tokens leaves the battlefield.
2019/05/03: A land normally has no color, even if it can produce one or more colors of mana.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Ajani's Pridemate>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/05/03: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers only once.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: Any counters that are put on Gideon remain on him while he's not a creature, even if they have no effect on a noncreature planeswalker.
2019/05/03: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon during your turn, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.

2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: The War of the Spark set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.

2019/05/03: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/05/03: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: If another creature with a +1/+1 counter on it is dealt lethal damage at the same time as <Martyr for the Cause>, the triggered ability can't proliferate a +1/+1 counter on the other creature in time to save it.
2019/05/03: The War of the Spark set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/05/03: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2019/05/03: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/05/03: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: Army is a new creature type. It's possible to control a nontoken Army (perhaps a creature with the changeling ability) and, through combinations of other cards, it's possible to control multiple Army tokens.

<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>
<Multiverseid>460980</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If you reveal a card this way, it remains revealed until Kefnet's triggered ability finishes resolving.
2019/05/03: It's important to reveal the first card you draw each turn (or choose not to reveal it) before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand. You look at the card as you draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.
2019/05/03: You don't have to reveal a drawn card if you don't wish to copy it at that time.
2019/05/03: You can reveal and copy an instant or sorcery card this way on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2019/05/03: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and copied with Kefnet's ability.
2019/05/03: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2019/05/03: You can cast the copy only as Kefnet's triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy ceases to exist. You can't cast it later.
2019/05/03: You can cast the copy during the resolution of the triggered ability if it's a sorcery, no matter whose turn it is or which phase it is.
2019/05/03: If the card leaves your hand before Kefnet's triggered ability resolves, you'll copy it using its last known information.
2019/05/03: The copy is created in and cast from your hand.
2019/05/03: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Kefnet's ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/05/03: If you somehow control more than one <God-Eternal Kefnet> (perhaps because one is a Spark Double), you may reveal a card you draw for any number of their abilities. One at a time, each will copy the card if it's an instant or sorcery, and you may cast each of them. Each copy resolves before you cast the next, and each copy's cost is reduced by only {2}.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: <Narset's Reversal> can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2019/05/03: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2019/05/03: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2019/05/03: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2019/05/03: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Finale of Promise does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2019/05/03: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2019/05/03: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2019/05/03: If you copy a spell, you control the copy. <Narset's Reversal> and the copy resolve before the original spell would have resolved.
2019/05/03: If a spell is returned to its owner's hand, it's removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn't countered; it just no longer exists. This works against a spell that can't be countered.

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Army is a new creature type.

<CardText>You may have Spark Double enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature or planeswalker you control, except it enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it if it's a creature, it enters with an additional loyalty counter on it if it's a planeswalker, and it isn't legendary if that permanent is legendary.</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>460995</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If the chosen permanent is copying something else (for example, if the chosen permanent is another <Spark Double>), then <Spark Double> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen permanent copied.
2019/05/03: <Spark Double> copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2019/05/03: <Spark Double> isn't legendary if it copies a legendary permanent, and this exception is copiable. If something else copies <Spark Double> later, that copy also won't be legendary. If you control two or more permanents with the same name but only one is legendary, the "legend rule" doesn't apply.
2019/05/03: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2019/05/03: If the chosen permanent is a token, <Spark Double> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Spark Double> doesn't become a token in this case.
2019/05/03: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when <Spark Double> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2019/05/03: If it copies a planeswalker, <Spark Double> enters with the appropriate number of loyalty counters as printed on the card plus one. If it copies a creature, <Spark Double> enters with a +1/+1 counter on it, plus any counters that will be put on it from abilities it copied and other abilities of other objects.
2019/05/03: If the copied permanent is affected by a type-changing effect, <Spark Double> may enter the battlefield with different permanent types than the copied permanent currently has. Use the characteristics of <Spark Double> as it enters the battlefield, not of the copied permanent, to determine whether it enters with an additional counter on it. Notably, if <Spark Double> copies a Gideon planeswalker that's a creature because its loyalty ability caused it to become a planeswalker creature, <Spark Double> enters as a noncreature planeswalker and doesn't get a +1/+1 counter. On the other hand, if <Spark Double> copies Gideon Blackblade during your turn, <Spark Double> enters as a planeswalker creature and gets both kinds of counters.
2019/05/03: If <Spark Double> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, it can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a creature or planeswalker that's already on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<CardText>At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 1 life and amass 1. (Put a +1/+1 counter on an Army you control. If you don't control one, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature token first.)

<Multiverseid>461013</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: The power of the Zombie token is checked only immediately after it attacks. Any other abilities that trigger when creatures you control attack won't have resolved yet.
2019/05/03: If the token's power changes later in the turn after it has attacked, including while <Dreadhorde Invasion>'s second ability is on the stack, it won't cause the token to gain or lose lifelink.
2019/05/03: Army is a new creature type. It's possible to control a nontoken Army (perhaps a creature with the changeling ability) and, through combinations of other cards, it's possible to control multiple Army tokens. When instructed to amass, you may put +1/+1 counters on any of your Army creatures, and you may choose a different one each time.
2019/05/03: If you don't control an Army, the Zombie Army token that you create enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield, such as that of Mentor of the Meek, will see the token enter as a 0/0 creature before it gets +1/+1 counters.
2019/05/03: Some cards that cause you to amass also provide bonuses to "Zombie tokens." These affect any token that happens to be a Zombie, not just a Zombie Army you've amassed.</Rulings>

<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: As Bontu's first triggered ability resolves, you may choose to sacrifice zero other permanents.
2019/05/03: If any abilities trigger as you sacrifice other permanents, those abilities won't be put onto the stack until after you've drawn cards.
2019/05/03: If a second <God-Eternal Bontu> enters the battlefield under your control, you'll put one into your graveyard before you can sacrifice anything to the new Bontu's triggered ability.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: As Liliana's second loyalty ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses two creatures they control, then each other player in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time. If any player can choose only one creature, that player does so.
2019/05/03: As Liliana's last ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) makes all of their choices for it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the unchosen permanents are sacrificed at the same time.
2019/05/03: The permanent types are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Supertypes, like legendary, aren't permanent types.
2019/05/03: While making choices for Liliana's last ability, if a permanent has more than one permanent type, it can count for any of them. For example, you could choose an artifact creature as the artifact you're sparing, another creature as the creature, and an enchantment creature as the enchantment. Similarly, you could choose an enchantment creature as both the creature and the enchantment that you're sparing, even if you control another creature and/or another enchantment.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: As <Liliana's Triumph> resolves, the opponent whose turn it is (or, if it's your turn, the next opponent in turn order) chooses a creature to sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them.

<Rulings>2019/05/03: You choose which player or planeswalker the new creature is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that Ilharg is attacking.
2019/05/03: Although the new creature is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for the purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example, such as those of Trusted Pegasus and Makeshift Battalion).
2019/05/03: If the new creature leaves the battlefield before the end step, most likely because it died in combat, that card remains in its current zone. It won't return to your hand.
2019/05/03: If the new creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger and resolve even if the creature is returned to your hand during the end step before that ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Jaya's first ability doesn't cause Jaya to deal damage; it affects the amount of damage dealt by the original red source.
2019/05/03: If another effect modifies how much damage your red source would deal, including preventing some of it, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses an order in which to apply those effects. If all of the damage is prevented, Jaya's effect no longer applies.
2019/05/03: If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control simultaneously, divide the original amount before adding 1. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 red creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then modified to 3 and 4, respectively.</Rulings>

When God-Eternal Rhonas enters the battlefield, double the power of each other creature you control until end of turn. Those creatures gain vigilance until end of turn.

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Rhonas's first triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't have their power doubled or gain vigilance.
2019/05/03: If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: Abilities that trigger while <Enter the God-Eternals> is resolving or that trigger as the target creature dies are all put onto the stack after the spell has finished resolving and the target creature has (if lethally damaged) died.

It's possible to control a nontoken Army (perhaps a creature with the changeling ability) and, through combinations of other cards, it's possible to control multiple Army tokens. When instructed to amass, you may put +1/+1 counters on any of your Army creatures, and you may choose a different one each time.

Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield, such as that of Mentor of the Meek, will see the token enter as a 0/0 creature before it gets +1/+1 counters.</Rulings>

It's possible to control a nontoken Army (perhaps a creature with the changeling ability) and, through combinations of other cards, it's possible to control multiple Army tokens. When instructed to amass, you may put +1/+1 counters on any of your Army creatures, and you may choose a different one each time.
2019/05/03: If you don't control an Army, the Zombie Army token that you create enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield, such as that of Mentor of the Meek, will see the token enter as a 0/0 creature before it gets +1/+1 counters.
2019/05/03: Some cards that cause you to amass also provide bonuses to "Zombie tokens." These affect any token that happens to be a Zombie, not just a Zombie Army you've amassed.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: While Nicol Bolas may end up with an astonishing number of loyalty abilities, you can still activate only one loyalty ability of <Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God> each turn.
2019/05/03: If a loyalty ability of a planeswalker references the card it's printed on by name, treat Nicol Bolas's instance of that ability as though it referenced <Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God> by name instead.

2019/05/03: If an ability of a planeswalker exiles cards and another loyalty ability of that planeswalker references the exiled cards, those abilities are linked. If Nicol Bolas gains both abilities, the instances he has are similarly linked. Cards exiled by any other abilities Nicol Bolas has (such as his own first loyalty ability) won't be seen by those linked abilities.
2019/05/03: If any abilities trigger as you draw a card while resolving Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability, those abilities don't resolve until after your opponents have exiled a card or permanent.
2019/05/03: After you draw a card as Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a permanent they control or chooses a card in hand without revealing that card. Then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Finally, all of the chosen cards are exiled simultaneously.

2019/05/03: Some spells instruct you to "copy target instant or sorcery spell." Because a spell is never a legal target for itself, you can't cast such a spell targeting itself to create a loop that causes Ral's first ability over and over.

<CardText>Spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause you to discard cards or sacrifice permanents.
[+1]: Choose a nonland card name, then reveal the top four cards of your library. Put all cards with the chosen name from among them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.
[-3]: Return target card from your graveyard to your hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>461147</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent or discard a card, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent or to discard a card, you can't take that option.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability an opponent controls states that something happens unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Mogis, God of Slaughter does) or discard a card (as Painful Quandary does), you can't choose to sacrifice or discard. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does) or discard a card unless you perform an action, you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since the spell or ability can't cause you to sacrifice any permanents or discard cards.
2019/05/03: Tamiyo's ability affects sacrifices, but not any other ways permanents can leave the battlefield. It won't stop a creature from dying due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability your opponent controls reduces your maximum hand size, Tamiyo's first ability won't stop you from discarding cards when the game rules cause you to discard during your cleanup step.
2019/05/03: If Tamiyo has 3 loyalty, you can't activate her last ability to return her to your hand. She won't be in your graveyard while you're choosing targets for the ability.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: You may activate Teferi's last ability without choosing any target. You'll just draw a card. However, if you do choose a target and the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Teferi's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: The War of the Spark set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/05/03: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2019/05/03: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/05/03: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jedd Chevrier</Artist>
<Multiverseid>461176</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If you control four or more legendary permanents that are creatures and/or planeswalkers, the last ability of <Mobilized District> costs no mana to activate. A legendary planeswalker that's also a creature reduces this cost by only {1}.
2019/05/03: If <Mobilized District> becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or activate its mana ability.
2019/05/03: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if <Mobilized District> has been made a 0/0 creature with nine +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 12/12 Citizen creature that's still a land.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: A non-Gideon creature is a creature that isn't also a Gideon planeswalker. For example, Gideon's Company is a non-Gideon creature.
2019/05/03: Any attacking Gideon creatures won't get a +1/+1 counter, but as long as two or more attacking creatures aren't Gideons, those attacking creatures each get a +1/+1 counter.
2019/05/03: Gideon's first loyalty ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
2019/05/03: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2019/05/03: Gideon's first loyalty ability causes him to become a creature with the creature type Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Soldier is just a creature type (not a planeswalker type).
2019/05/03: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his first loyalty ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he's also a creature, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If Gideon has 9 loyalty as you activate his last ability, he'll be put into your graveyard and won't be exiled.</Rulings>

For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Gideon's Company>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.

<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Tezzeret (Loyalty: 5)</Type>
<ManaCost>4UB (6)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Creature and planeswalker spells you cast have affinity for artifacts. (They cost {1} less to cast for each artifact you control.)
[+2]: Tezzeret, Master of the Bridge deals X damage to each opponent, where X is the number of artifacts you control. You gain X life.

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Affinity for artifacts means "This spell costs {1} less for each artifact you control."
2019/05/03: Tezzeret himself doesn't have affinity for artifacts.
2019/05/03: Affinity doesn't change the spell's converted mana cost. It changes only how much mana you pay to cast the spell.
2019/05/03: Affinity can reduce only generic mana in a spell's cost. It can't reduce color requirements.
2019/05/03: The cost reduction is set before you pay any of the spell's costs. Specifically, you could lock in a discount for an artifact you control and then sacrifice that artifact to activate a mana ability.
2019/05/03: If there are any additional costs or cost increases that would apply to a spell with affinity, apply those before applying any cost reductions.
2019/05/03: If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each applies.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Tezzeret's first loyalty ability causes the opposing team to lose twice X life and you gain X life.</Rulings>
