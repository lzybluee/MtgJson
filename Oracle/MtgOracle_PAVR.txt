When Restoration Angel enters the battlefield, you may exile target non-Angel creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under your control.</CardText>
<Artist>Wesley Burt</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: Once the exiled creature returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2017/11/17: The returned creature won't be the target of any spells or abilities that targeted it before. Any spells that don't target it, such as Austere Command, will still affect it.
2017/11/17: If you target a creature that you control but don't own, you control the returned creature indefinitely after it returns. When you leave a multiplayer game, exile any objects that you put onto the battlefield under your control but don't own.
2017/11/17: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.</Rulings>

<CardText>For each creature, its controller sacrifices it unless they pay X life.</CardText>
<Artist>Michael Komarck</Artist>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: First, the active player chooses whether to pay X life for each creature they control. Then each other player in turn order chooses for their creatures. Then each player pays life and sacrifices creatures at the same time. Players will know the decisions of players who chose before them.
2012/05/01: A player may choose to pay life for some creatures and sacrifice the rest. It's not an all-or-nothing decision.
2012/05/01: You can't pay more life than you have.
2012/05/01: If you can't sacrifice a creature (perhaps because of Sigarda, Host of Herons), you can choose not to pay life and nothing will happen.</Rulings>
