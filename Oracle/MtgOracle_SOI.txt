Delirium — Whenever Angel of Deliverance deals damage, if there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard, exile target creature an opponent controls.</CardText>
<Artist>Joseph Meehan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409738</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: If <Angel of Deliverance> deals damage to multiple creatures, players, or planeswalkers at once (for example, if it's blocked by two smaller creatures) its last ability triggers only once.
2016/04/08: If <Angel of Deliverance> deals damage and is dealt lethal damage at the same time, its ability will trigger.
2016/04/08: If <Angel of Deliverance> deals lethal damage to a creature, that creature can't be targeted by <Angel of Deliverance>'s triggered ability. It's already in its owner's graveyard.
2016/04/08: If you have three noncreature card types among cards in your graveyard and <Angel of Deliverance> deals damage at the same time another creature you control is dealt lethal damage, the ability won't trigger. The creature doesn't die until after <Angel of Deliverance>'s ability checks to see if it triggers.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

Delirium — At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, if there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard, tap target creature that player controls.</CardText>
<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409785</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Artist>Clint Cearley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409792</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: <Invasive Surgery>'s delirium ability isn't checked until after the sorcery spell has been countered. If that spell is put into your graveyard, it will be counted.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"There's nothing to worry about."</Flavor>
<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409814</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409816</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The upkeep step is before the draw step, after the untap step. <Manic Scribe>'s delirium ability mills an opponent's library before that player draws a card during their draw step.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: A sorcery can't be put onto the battlefield and a permanent can't transform into a sorcery. If an effect exiles <Persistent Nightmare> and then instructs you to return it to the battlefield, it remains face up in exile (unless that effect instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it returns as <Persistent Nightmare>). If an effect instructs you to transform <Persistent Nightmare>, the instruction is ignored.
2016/04/08: Skulk matters only as blockers are chosen. Modifying either creature's power after blockers are chosen won't cause the attacking creature to become unblocked.
2016/04/08: If you cause a creature to have 0 power or less, use the actual value (which may be negative) to determine whether it can block or be blocked. A creature with skulk and 0 or less power most likely won't be blocked, but it won't deal combat damage and won't trigger any abilities that trigger when combat damage is dealt.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: The toughness of the creature is checked only as <Welcome to the Fold> resolves. It doesn't matter if it has higher toughness as you cast <Welcome to the Fold>, or if its toughness becomes higher after <Welcome to the Fold> has resolved.
2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

2016/04/08: <Asylum Visitor>'s triggered ability checks the active player's hand as the upkeep begins and as the trigger resolves. If that player has a card in hand as it resolves, you won't draw a card or lose 1 life.

<CardText>At the beginning of your upkeep, each player discards a card. Each opponent who discarded a card that shares a card type with the card you discarded loses 3 life. (Players reveal the discarded cards simultaneously.)</CardText>
<Artist>Anthony Palumbo</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409851</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: When a spell or ability instructs each player to discard a card, starting with the player whose turn it is and proceeding in turn order, each player selects a card from their hand without revealing it, sets it aside, and then all of those cards are revealed and discarded at once.
2016/04/08: The card types that may be shared for <Creeping Dread>'s ability are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: If a player has no cards in hand, that player doesn't discard a card while everyone else does. If you didn't discard a card, no player can have discarded a card that shares a card type with the card you discarded, so no player loses 3 life.
2016/04/08: If an opponent discards a card that shares two card types with the card you discarded, such as an artifact creature, that player still only loses 3 life.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, a double-faced card with different card types among its faces (such as Skin Invasion) only compares its front face to the other discarded cards.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409874</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: <Mindwrack Demon>'s delirium triggered ability does not include an intervening "if" clause. This ability triggers at the beginning of your upkeep regardless of the number of types in your graveyard, and it checks that number as it resolves to determine whether you lose 4 life or not.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.

<Rulings>2016/04/08: If you control three <Vildin-Pack Alpha>s and a Werewolf enters the battlefield under your control, you may transform it, transform it again, and transform it a third time.
2016/04/08: If a creature with haste transforms and no longer has haste on the same turn that it comes under your control, such as if you cast a Geier Reach Bandit when you already control a <Vildin-Pack Alpha>, it won't be able to attack that turn.
2016/04/08: The abilities that transform a Werewolf back and forth look at the entire previous turn, even if the Werewolf with that ability wasn't on the battlefield for some or all of that turn.
2016/04/08: To trigger the Werewolf's back face's transform ability, a single player must have cast two or more spells during the previous turn. If multiple players each cast just one spell during the previous turn, the ability won't trigger.</Rulings>

{2}{U}, Exile Geistblast from your graveyard: Copy target instant or sorcery spell you control. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409914</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: <Geistblast>'s ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2016/04/08: When <Geistblast>'s ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, before the original spell resolves but after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2016/04/08: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/04/08: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/04/08: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Avacyn's Judgment's madness cost has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2016/04/08: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (also like Avacyn's Judgment), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2016/04/08: If an alternative cost was paid for the spell, such as its madness cost or surge cost, the same alternative cost is considered to have been paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409915</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

2016/04/08: You choose whether to cast the targeted card as the ability resolves. You can't wait to cast it later, and there's no way for your opponents to set up a situation where you have to cast the card but don't want to.
2016/04/08: If the spell you cast from your hand is countered in response to <Harness the Storm>'s triggered ability, you can still cast the target card while the ability is resolving.
2016/04/08: Because you're paying the spell's costs, you can pay alternative costs, such as awaken costs and surge costs from the Battle for Zendikar block. You can also pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has a mandatory additional cost, like Lightning Axe, you must pay it to cast the card.

<Multiverseid>409920</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jama Jurabaev</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409934</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.</Rulings>

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>409935</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.

2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.

<Rulings>2016/04/08: No player may take any action in between the two steps of <Confront the Unknown>, so the target creature will get at least +1/+1.
2016/04/08: The token is named Clue and has the artifact subtype Clue. Clue isn't a creature type.
2016/04/08: The tokens are normal artifacts. For example, they can be sacrificed to cast Angelic Purge or targeted by Root Out.
2016/04/08: If you sacrifice a Clue for another card's cost or effect, such as that of Angelic Purge or Tamiyo's Journal, you can't also pay {2} and sacrifice it to draw a card.
2016/04/08: You can't cast a spell without choosing legal targets. If all of those targets become illegal, the spell doesn't resolve and you won't investigate.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: If you have three noncreature card types among cards in your graveyard at the time damage is dealt by <Deathcap Cultivator>, and lethal damage is dealt to another creature you control at the same time, the damage from <Deathcap Cultivator> won't be from a source with deathtouch.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist.

<Rulings>2016/04/08: You declare which player or planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker <Inexorable Blob> is attacking.
2016/04/08: Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2016/04/08: If an effect gives the token vigilance, the token will still enter the battlefield tapped.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.

2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Some delirium abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." These spells have an upgraded effect when they resolve if there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard. They check that number only while they're resolving and don't count themselves, since they aren't in your graveyard yet. You only get the upgraded effect, not both effects.</Rulings>

<CardText>This spell can't be countered.
You may have Altered Ego enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it.</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>410005</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: <Altered Ego> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/04/08: If you copy a double-faced creature, <Altered Ego> will be a copy of the face that's up when <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield. Because <Altered Ego> is not a double-faced card, it won't be able to transform. If an effect instructs you to return it to the battlefield transformed when it leaves the battlefield, it won't return and will remain in its new zone.
2016/04/08: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, that X is considered to be 0. The value of X in <Altered Ego>'s last ability will be whatever value was chosen for X while casting <Altered Ego>.
2016/04/08: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Altered Ego>), then your <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2016/04/08: If the chosen creature is a token, <Altered Ego> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Altered Ego> isn't a token.
2016/04/08: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2016/04/08: If <Altered Ego> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Altered Ego> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2016/04/08: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately. It won't have +1/+1 counters placed on it by its ability.
2016/04/08: X can be 0. <Altered Ego> won't enter with any additional +1/+1 counters, and it will just be a copy of the chosen creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: Skulk matters only as blockers are chosen. Modifying either creature's power after blockers are chosen won't cause the attacking creature to become unblocked.
2016/04/08: If you cause a creature to have 0 power or less, use the actual value (which may be negative) to determine whether it can block or be blocked. A creature with skulk and 0 or less power most likely won't be blocked, but it won't deal combat damage and won't trigger any abilities that trigger when combat damage is dealt.</Rulings>
