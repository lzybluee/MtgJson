<Artist>Johann Bodin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442740</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Forestcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Forest card. After you find a Forest card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager.
2008/10/01: This effect doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of an artifact spell. Rather, it reduces the total cost of the spell, which is the amount you actually pay while casting it. The total cost takes into account additional or alternative costs.
2008/10/01: This effect can reduce only the generic portion of the artifact spell's total cost.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/07/13: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/07/13: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2018/07/13: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2018/07/13: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2018/07/13: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Saheeli's Directive and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{R}{R}{R}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{R}{R}{R}.</Rulings>
