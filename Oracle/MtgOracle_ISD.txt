If the card has an ability that allows another cost to be paid "rather than its mana cost," that alternative cost can be paid. Other alternative costs that affect what it costs to cast a creature spell, such as evoke, can't.
2011/09/22: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the creature will also work.
2011/09/22: If you exile a double-faced creature card this way, you'll pay the mana cost of the front face. The token will be a copy of the front face and it won't be able to transform.

<Rulings>2017/03/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is an Evil Twin), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.</Rulings>

The first such ability to resolve will exile that creature card and create a Zombie token. Subsequent abilities won't exile the creature card, but each will create another Zombie token.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/03/14: Only creatures on the battlefield will be exiled. In other zones, they're "creature cards," not "creatures."
2017/03/14: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Sever the Bloodline> resolves, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No creatures will be exiled.
2017/03/14: Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named "Beast."
2017/03/14: A double-faced creature only has the name of the face that's up. For example, if Village Ironsmith is targeted by <Sever the Bloodline>, Ironfang wouldn't be exiled.</Rulings>

<Flavor>Wander too far into the wild and it may take you for its own.</Flavor>
<Artist>Terese Nielsen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>254133</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Creatures you control don't copy whether <Essence of the Wild> is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2011/09/22: Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of <Essence of the Wild>, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger.
2011/09/22: Replacement effects that modify how a creature enters the battlefield are applied in the following order: first control-changing effects (such as Gather Specimens), then copy effects (such as the abilities of <Essence of the Wild> and Clone), then all other effects. This is a minor rules change to make <Essence of the Wild> and similar cards in the future work intuitively.
2011/09/22: If a creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and <Essence of the Wild>'s. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of <Essence of the Wild> when it enters the battlefield.
2011/09/22: Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be <Essence of the Wild> at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped <Essence of the Wild>, and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as an <Essence of the Wild> with no counters.
2011/09/22: External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls Urabrask the Hidden, which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped <Essence of the Wild>.
2011/09/22: If a creature such as Cryptoplasm that's already on the battlefield copies <Essence of the Wild> and modifies its own copy effect, that modification is also copied by creatures entering the battlefield under your control.
2011/09/22: If you control more than one <Essence of the Wild>, creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.

<Rulings>2009/10/01: If a <Blazing Torch> controlled by one player somehow winds up equipping a creature a different player controls, the damage ability can't be activated by either player. Only the creature's controller may activate the ability — but since that player can't sacrifice <Blazing Torch> (a permanent they don't control), the ability's cost can't be paid.
2009/10/01: The source of the damage is <Blazing Torch>, not the equipped creature. However, the equipped creature's ability is what targets the permanent or player. If <Blazing Torch> is equipped to a red creature, for example, the ability couldn't target a creature with protection from red. It could target a creature with protection from artifacts, but all the damage would be prevented.</Rulings>

For example, if a 5/5 creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.</Rulings>
