If the card has an ability that allows another cost to be paid "rather than its mana cost," that alternative cost can be paid. Other alternative costs that affect what it costs to cast a creature spell, such as evoke, can't.
2011/09/22: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the creature will also work.
2011/09/22: If you exile a double-faced creature card this way, you'll pay the mana cost of the front face. The token will be a copy of the front face and it won't be able to transform.

<Rulings>2017/03/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
2017/03/14: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is an Evil Twin), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.

<CardText>Creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the Wild.</CardText>
<Flavor>Wander too far into the wild and it may take you for its own.</Flavor>
<Artist>Terese Nielsen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>254133</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Creatures you control don't copy whether <Essence of the Wild> is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2011/09/22: Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of <Essence of the Wild>, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger.
2011/09/22: Replacement effects that modify how a creature enters the battlefield are applied in the following order: first control-changing effects (such as Gather Specimens), then copy effects (such as the abilities of <Essence of the Wild> and Clone), then all other effects. This is a minor rules change to make <Essence of the Wild> and similar cards in the future work intuitively.
2011/09/22: If a creature such as Clone is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and <Essence of the Wild>'s. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of <Essence of the Wild> when it enters the battlefield.
2011/09/22: Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be <Essence of the Wild> at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped <Essence of the Wild>, and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as an <Essence of the Wild> with no counters.
2011/09/22: External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls Urabrask the Hidden, which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped <Essence of the Wild>.
2011/09/22: If a creature such as Cryptoplasm that's already on the battlefield copies <Essence of the Wild> and modifies its own copy effect, that modification is also copied by creatures entering the battlefield under your control.
2011/09/22: If you control more than one <Essence of the Wild>, creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.</Rulings>

Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2018/03/16: Any toughness-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will apply after its toughness is set to your former life total. For example, say <Tree of Redemption> is enchanted with Lunarch Mantle (which makes it 2/15) and your life total is 7. After the exchange, <Tree of Redemption> would be a 2/9 creature (its toughness became 7, which was then modified by Lunarch Mantle) and your life total would be 15.</Rulings>

It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/03/14: The activated ability that <Evil Twin> gains as part of its copy effect is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Evil Twin>), then your <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2017/03/14: If the chosen creature is a token, <Evil Twin> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Evil Twin> is not a token in this case.
2017/03/14: Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named "Beast."
2017/03/14: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2017/03/14: If <Evil Twin> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Evil Twin> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2017/03/14: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Evil Twin> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: If a creature is equipped with a second <Inquisitor's Flail>, combat damage dealt by and dealt to that creature will be multiplied by four. A third <Inquisitor's Flail> would multiply the combat damage by eight, and so on.
2011/09/22: If you divide the combat damage dealt by the equipped creature, perhaps because the creature has trample or is dealing combat damage to multiple creatures, you'll divide the original amount and then double the results. For example, if a 5/5 creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.</Rulings>
