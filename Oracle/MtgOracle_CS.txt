<Artist>Wayne Reynolds</Artist>
<Multiverseid>121140</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/07/15: <Cover of Winter>'s replacement effect prevents combat damage creatures would deal to you and to attacking or blocking creatures you control.
2006/07/15: If multiple creatures would deal combat damage to you and your creatures at the same time, this prevents X of the damage that would be dealt by each of them. This prevention is applied creature by creature. For example, if <Cover of Winter> has two age counters and you're being attacked by an unblocked 1/1 and an unblocked 4/4, this will prevent 2 of the combat damage that would be dealt by each one. All damage from the 1/1 is prevented and 2 damage from the 4/4 is prevented, meaning you're dealt 2 damage.
2006/07/15: If a creature has double strike, <Cover of Winter> prevents X of the combat damage it would deal during each combat damage step.
2006/07/15: If a creature's combat damage is assigned to multiple recipients (for example, if it has trample and is blocked by two creatures, and damage is assigned to each of those creatures and to you), you decide how to divide the prevention effect. You may prevent damage that would be dealt to the first creature, the second creature, and/or you, as long as the total amount of that creature's damage that would be prevented is X.</Rulings>

You may either change those targets to be legal in reference to you, or, if those are the spell's only targets, the spell doesn't resolve for having illegal targets.

<Rulings>2006/07/15: If an opponent casts a spell with X in its mana cost, the converted mana cost of that spell takes the value of X into account. If you reveal a card with X in its mana cost, X is 0. For example, if your opponent casts Blaze with X=1, <Counterbalance> will counter that spell if you reveal a card with converted mana cost 2, but it won't counter that spell if you reveal a Blaze of your own.
2017/04/18: If an opponent casts half of a split card (for example, Hit), it won't be countered if you reveal that same split card. The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves, but the converted mana cost of Hit is determined using only that half's mana cost.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying
Cumulative upkeep—Gain control of a land you don't control. (At the beginning of your upkeep, put an age counter on this permanent, then sacrifice it unless you pay its upkeep cost for each age counter on it.)
Herald of Leshrac gets +1/+1 for each land you control but don't own.
When Herald of Leshrac leaves the battlefield, each player gains control of each land they own that you control.</CardText>
<Artist>Alex Horley-Orlandelli</Artist>
<Multiverseid>121250</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/07/15: When <Herald of Leshrac>'s cumulative upkeep ability resolves, if its age counters outnumber the number of lands on the battlefield that you don't control, you can't pay its cumulative upkeep cost and must sacrifice it.
2006/07/15: You must choose a different land you don't control for each age counter on <Herald of Leshrac>. Otherwise, you'd try to gain control of a land you *do* control midway through paying the cost and need to back up.
2006/07/15: <Herald of Leshrac>'s leaves-the-battlefield ability affects all lands you control but don't own, not just the ones you gained control of with <Herald of Leshrac>. For example, if you had gained control of an opponent's land with Annex, its owner will regain control of that land. Annex will remain attached to it, but its effect will be overridden.
2013/04/15: The cumulative upkeep trigger doesn't target what you gain control of, and you don't choose lands until the ability resolves. Your opponents can not tap lands in response to the choice, but they could respond to the ability by tapping any number of lands before you've made any choices.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/07/15: The coin flip rules have changed. You now win or lose a flip only if *you* flipped the coin. If your opponent loses a flip, that no longer means that you win that flip. Only coin flips caused by cards that say "win" and/or "lose" anywhere on them have a winner or loser.
2006/07/15: If a spell or ability uses a coin flip to determine what happens on a heads result versus a tails result, the flipping player doesn't call "heads" or "tails." Such flips have no winner or loser.
2006/07/15: When <Karplusan Minotaur>'s cumulative upkeep ability resolves, you either flip a number of coins equal to the number of age counters on it, or you sacrifice it. Once you start to flip, you can't stop; you must continue until all flips are made. If you flip, you call heads or tails for each flip. Each time you're right, the Minotaur's second ability triggers. Each time you're wrong, the Minotaur's third ability triggers. The triggers wait until after you're done flipping, then they all go on the stack in whatever order you choose. Each may have a different target.
2006/07/15: The Minotaur's last two abilities will trigger whenever you win or lose any coin flip. For example, if you cast Stitch in Time, one of the Minotaur's abilities will trigger.</Rulings>

<CardText>Lightning Storm deals X damage to any target, where X is 3 plus the number of charge counters on Lightning Storm.
Discard a land card: Put two charge counters on Lightning Storm. You may choose a new target for it. Any player may activate this ability but only if Lightning Storm is on the stack.</CardText>
<Artist>Luca Zontini</Artist>
<Multiverseid>121495</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/07/15: <Lightning Storm> has an activated ability that can be activated only while the spell is on the stack. Any player may activate that ability. When the ability is activated, it goes on the stack on top of <Lightning Storm>. When the ability resolves, the <Lightning Storm> spell is affected.
2006/07/15: When you cast <Lightning Storm>, you immediately have a chance to activate its ability since you'll have priority. If you don't, and all other players pass, the spell will resolve. You won't receive priority again — and thus won't get another chance to activate its ability — unless someone else activates <Lightning Storm>'s activated ability, casts some other spell, or activates some other ability.
2006/07/15: After an instance of <Lightning Storm>'s activated ability resolves, the active player (not <Lightning Storm>'s controller) receives priority.
2006/07/15: When <Lightning Storm>'s activated ability resolves, if there are no other legal targets to choose for the <Lightning Storm> spell, you must leave the target the same, even if it's now an illegal target.
2006/07/15: When <Lightning Storm> leaves the stack, its charge counters go away.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jim Pavelec</Artist>
<Multiverseid>121264</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/07/15: <Panglacial Wurm>'s ability works only while you're searching your own library. The effect that caused you to search needs to say "search" and "library," and you need to be looking through your own library for this to work. Examples of effects that let you cast <Panglacial Wurm> are Rampant Growth and Gifts Ungiven. Examples of effects that don't are Bribery and Sage Owl.
2006/07/15: Casting <Panglacial Wurm> while searching your library follows all the normal rules for casting a creature spell, except for timing (casting the Wurm this way always occurs during the resolution of another spell or ability) and what zone the Wurm is being cast from. The spell goes on the stack. You have to pay the Wurm's mana cost and any applicable additional costs, which means you can activate mana abilities while you're casting the Wurm while you're searching your library.
2006/07/15: After you cast <Panglacial Wurm>, you pick up the search effect where you left off. When the search effect finishes resolving, the active player gets priority with <Panglacial Wurm> on the stack. Any abilities that triggered when the spell was cast are put on the stack now.
2006/07/15: If you have enough mana, you can cast multiple <Panglacial Wurm>s during a single search effect.
2006/07/15: A <Panglacial Wurm> that you cast while searching your library can't be found by the search effect.
2006/07/15: If you want to cast <Panglacial Wurm> while searching your library, you must do so before you find any cards with the search effect.
2006/07/15: While searching your library, you must keep your library in the same order until you shuffle it. This order could matter if you tap Millikin for mana, for example, to pay for a <Panglacial Wurm> you cast from your library.</Rulings>
