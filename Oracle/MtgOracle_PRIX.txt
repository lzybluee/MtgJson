<CardText>When Bishop of Binding enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Bishop of Binding leaves the battlefield.
Whenever Bishop of Binding attacks, target Vampire gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the power of the exiled card.</CardText>
<Artist>Bastien L. Deharme</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: If <Bishop of Binding> leaves the battlefield before its first triggered ability tries to resolve, the target creature won't be exiled.
2018/01/19: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2018/01/19: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2018/01/19: The value of X is determined only as <Bishop of Binding>'s second ability resolves. It won't change if the card leaves exile later in the turn.
2018/01/19: If there is no exiled card as <Bishop of Binding>'s last ability resolves, most likely because <Bishop of Binding> left the battlefield while that ability was on the stack, X is 0. The same is true if the exiled card doesn't have a power, most likely because it's a noncreature card that had become a creature.
2018/01/19: If a Vehicle is exiled with <Bishop of Binding>, use its printed power to determine the value of X.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If you control ten permanents but don't control a permanent or resolving spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing. For example, if you control ten permanents, lose control of one, then cast Golden Demise, you won't have the city's blessing and the spell will affect creatures you control.

This means that if your tenth permanent is a land you play, players can't respond before you get the city's blessing.

This is true even if the entering permanent is your tenth permanent.
2018/01/19: To choose a creature type, you must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Knight. You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Vampire Knight."

<CardText>Flash
When Crafty Cutpurse enters the battlefield, each token that would be created under an opponent's control this turn is created under your control instead.</CardText>
<Flavor>Possession is eleven-tenths of the pirate code.</Flavor>
<Artist>Grzegorz Rutkowski</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: <Crafty Cutpurse>'s replacement effect is applied before any other replacement effects that would also modify how the token enters the battlefield. For example, if an opponent controls Anointed Procession, your <Crafty Cutpurse>'s effect applies before that of Anointed Procession and you won't get twice as many tokens.
2018/01/19: <Crafty Cutpurse> won't retroactively change the control of tokens that have already entered the battlefield.
2018/01/19: If a token would be created tapped and attacking, but the token's controller isn't an attacking player, that token is created tapped but not attacking. If a token would be created blocking a creature, but the token's controller isn't a defending player, that token is created but isn't blocking.
2018/01/19: If the effect that creates the token also creates a delayed triggered ability, <Crafty Cutpurse> doesn't change who controls that ability. For example, if your opponent activates the ability of Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker, that opponent controls the delayed triggered ability. When the ability triggers, that player can't sacrifice the token, so it remains on the battlefield.
2018/01/19: On the other hand, if the effect that creates the token grants a triggered ability to the token, the player who controls the token at the time the ability triggers will be the player who controls that ability. For example, if your opponent activates the second ability of Jace, Cunning Castaway, the token has the ability. If the ability triggers, you'll control it, so you'll have to sacrifice the token.
2018/01/19: If two or more players each have resolved <Crafty Cutpurse>'s triggered ability and a token would be created, the token's would-be controller chooses one of the applicable <Crafty Cutpurse> effects to apply. Then the new would-be controller of the token repeats this process among the remaining <Crafty Cutpurse> effects, and so on, until there are no more possible such effects to apply. Each effect can be applied to the token only once this way.
2018/01/19: The above procedure means that if each player in a two-player game has resolved <Crafty Cutpurse>'s triggered ability and one would create a token, it really will enter the battlefield under that player's control. The token would enter the battlefield under player A's control, so player B's effect affects it. Now that token would enter the battlefield under player B's control, so player A's effect affects it. Each replacement effect has now been used, so the token will enter the battlefield under player A's control.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If your tenth permanent enters the battlefield and then a permanent leaves the battlefield immediately afterwards (most likely due to the "Legend Rule" or due to being a creature with 0 toughness), you get the city's blessing before it leaves the battlefield.
2018/01/19: Ascend on a permanent isn't a triggered ability and doesn't use the stack. Players can respond to a spell that will give you your tenth permanent, but they can't respond to getting the city's blessing once you control that tenth permanent.

Whenever an opponent casts a noncreature spell, draw a card.
Discard three cards: Exile Nezahal. Return it to the battlefield tapped under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Artist>Sam Burley</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: Your maximum hand size is checked only during the cleanup step on your turn. If Nezahal's last ability is activated before your turn's end step, it will return before your next cleanup step and you'll have no maximum hand size.
2018/01/19: Nezahal's triggered ability resolves before the noncreature spell that caused it to trigger.
2018/01/19: Players can cast spells and activate abilities after Nezahal's triggered ability resolves but before the spell that caused it to trigger does. Notably, the card you draw may be able to counter that spell or may be discarded to activate Nezahal's last ability.
2018/01/19: After Nezahal returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the creature that was exiled. It won't be in combat or have any additional abilities it may have had when it was exiled. Any +1/+1 counters on it or Auras attached to it are removed, and any Equipment will no longer be attached.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: If a token is exiled this way, it can't be cast.

2018/01/19: Casting the exiled card follows the normal timing rules for casting that card. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2018/01/19: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Silvergill Adept, those must be paid to cast the card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Once you have the city's blessing, you have it for the rest of the game, even if you lose control of some or all of your permanents. The city's blessing isn't a permanent itself and can't be removed by any effect.
2018/01/19: A permanent is any object on the battlefield, including tokens and lands. Spells and emblems aren't permanents.
2018/01/19: If you cast a spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing until it resolves. Players may respond to that spell by trying to change whether you get the city's blessing.
2018/01/19: If you control ten permanents but don't control a permanent or resolving spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing. For example, if you control ten permanents, lose control of one, then cast Golden Demise, you won't have the city's blessing and the spell will affect creatures you control.
2018/01/19: If your tenth permanent enters the battlefield and then a permanent leaves the battlefield immediately afterwards (most likely due to the "Legend Rule" or due to being a creature with 0 toughness), you get the city's blessing before it leaves the battlefield.
2018/01/19: Ascend on a permanent isn't a triggered ability and doesn't use the stack. Players can respond to a spell that will give you your tenth permanent, but they can't respond to getting the city's blessing once you control that tenth permanent. This means that if your tenth permanent is a land you play, players can't respond before you get the city's blessing.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
2018/01/19: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from <Dead Man's Chest>'s ability are exiled.</Rulings>

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: If an exiled card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2018/01/19: If you cast any of the exiled cards, you do so as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. You can't wait to cast them later in the turn. Timing permissions based on a card's type are ignored, and the spells resolve before blockers are declared.
2018/01/19: If you cast more than one of the exiled cards, you choose the order in which to cast them. A spell you cast this way can be the target of a later spell you cast this way. However, permanent spells cast this way won't resolve until you're done casting spells, so the permanents they become can't be the target of spells cast this way. For example, if you exile Twincast and Lightning Strike, you can cast Lightning Strike and then cast Twincast targeting it; but if you exile a creature card and an Aura card, you can't cast that Aura targeting that creature.
2018/01/19: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Silvergill Adept, those must be paid to cast the card.
2018/01/19: Any cards not cast, including land cards, remain in exile. They can't be cast on later turns, even if Etali attacks again.
2018/01/19: Because all attacking creatures are chosen at once, a creature cast this way can't attack during the same combat as Etali, even if it has haste.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: For your life total to become 15, you gain or lose the appropriate amount of life.

Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2018/01/19: <Form of the Dinosaur>'s last ability isn't optional. You have to pick a fight with an opponent's creature if any are legal targets. If that creature leaves the battlefield after it becomes the target of <Form of the Dinosaur>'s ability but before it resolves, you won't be dealt damage.

For example, if you control three 2/2 creatures, including one you can sacrifice to add {C}, the total cost of Ghalta is {4}{G}{G}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2018/01/19: If a creature's power is somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of your other creatures. If the total power of your creatures is 0 or less, Ghalta's cost remains {10}{G}{G}.
2018/01/19: Ghalta's first ability can't reduce its cost below {G}{G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: To determine Ghalta's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: The token will have <Polyraptor>'s ability. It will also be able to create copies of itself.
2018/01/19: The token won't copy counters or damage marked on <Polyraptor>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Polyraptor>'s power, toughness, types, color, or so on.

2018/01/19: If you control ten permanents but don't control a permanent or resolving spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing. For example, if you control ten permanents, lose control of one, then cast Golden Demise, you won't have the city's blessing and the spell will affect creatures you control.
2018/01/19: If your tenth permanent enters the battlefield and then a permanent leaves the battlefield immediately afterwards (most likely due to the "Legend Rule" or due to being a creature with 0 toughness), you get the city's blessing before it leaves the battlefield.

2018/01/19: If an object has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0. A converted mana cost of 0 can still help unlock <Azor's Gateway>.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Once you have the city's blessing, you have it for the rest of the game, even if you lose control of some or all of your permanents. The city's blessing isn't a permanent itself and can't be removed by any effect.
2018/01/19: A permanent is any object on the battlefield, including tokens and lands. Spells and emblems aren't permanents.
2018/01/19: If you cast a spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing until it resolves. Players may respond to that spell by trying to change whether you get the city's blessing.
2018/01/19: If you control ten permanents but don't control a permanent or resolving spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing. For example, if you control ten permanents, lose control of one, then cast Golden Demise, you won't have the city's blessing and the spell will affect creatures you control.
2018/01/19: If your tenth permanent enters the battlefield and then a permanent leaves the battlefield immediately afterwards (most likely due to the "Legend Rule" or due to being a creature with 0 toughness), you get the city's blessing before it leaves the battlefield.
2018/01/19: Ascend on a permanent isn't a triggered ability and doesn't use the stack. Players can respond to a spell that will give you your tenth permanent, but they can't respond to getting the city's blessing once you control that tenth permanent. This means that if your tenth permanent is a land you play, players can't respond before you get the city's blessing.</Rulings>
