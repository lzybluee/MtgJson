<Rulings>2004/10/04: If a copy card goes to the graveyard under this effect, you get to look for another copy of the card it was copying. This is because a copy card actually takes on the name and initial characteristics of what it copies.
2004/10/04: Because the "search" requires you to find a card with certain characteristics, you don't have to find the card if you don't want to.
2010/03/01: If a card which is a creature only due to an effect goes to the graveyard, you can search for another copy of that card even though the card in your library won't be a creature card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This replacement effect replaces the draw, so nothing that triggers on a draw will trigger.

In other words, you reveal and then put on the bottom of the library for the first card, then do the same for the second, and so on. In a multi-card draw you do not have to choose how many of those draws will be replaced before you do any drawing or use of this card.
2004/10/04: If no card of the chosen type is found before your library empties, you don't get a card, but you do get to order all the cards in your library any way you choose.
2007/07/15: If your library is empty, <Abundance> can prevent you from losing the game for being unable to draw a card. If an effect or turn-based action would cause you to draw a card, you can replace that draw with <Abundance>'s replacement effect. (It doesn't matter that you'd be unable to actually draw a card.) Since <Abundance>'s effect has you put a card into your hand instead of drawing a card, you'll never be forced to draw a card with an empty library.</Rulings>
