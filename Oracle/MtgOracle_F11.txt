<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Watermark>Fnm</Watermark>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: The value of X needs to be determined both when the ability triggers (so you can choose a target) and again when the ability resolves (to check if that target is still legal). If the number of Faeries you control has decreased enough in that time to make the target illegal, <Spellstutter Sprite>'s ability won't resolve (and the targeted spell will resolve as normal).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before they declare blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.</Rulings>

<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: You can choose any player that has a counter, including yourself.
2011/01/01: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them, such as suspended cards or a Lightning Storm on the stack.
2011/01/01: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2011/01/01: If a permanent chosen this way has multiple kinds of counters on it, only a single new counter is put on that permanent.
2011/01/01: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2011/01/01: <Contagion Clasp>'s first ability is mandatory. If you're the only player who controls a creature, you must target one of them.</Rulings>
