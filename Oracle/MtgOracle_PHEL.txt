<Flavor>A golden helix streaked skyward from the Helvault. A thunderous explosion shattered the silver monolith and Avacyn emerged, free from her prison at last.</Flavor>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: A permanent with indestructible can't be destroyed, but it can still be sacrificed, exiled, put into a graveyard, and so on. Notably, a permanent with indestructible can be put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule."
2017/11/17: Creatures with indestructible still have damage marked on them, even though that damage won't destroy them. If Avacyn leaves the battlefield, creatures that lose indestructible and have lethal damage marked on them will be destroyed.
2017/11/17: A creature with 0 toughness is put into its owner's graveyard even if it has indestructible.
2017/11/17: A planeswalker with indestructible still loses loyalty as it's dealt damage. It is put into its owner's graveyard if its loyalty becomes 0.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying, vigilance
Whenever Bruna, Light of Alabaster attacks or blocks, you may attach to it any number of Auras on the battlefield and you may put onto the battlefield attached to it any number of Aura cards that could enchant it from your graveyard and/or hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Winona Nelson</Artist>
<Rulings>2012/05/01: Only Auras that could legally enchant Bruna may be attached to it, whether they're being moved from other permanents or being put onto the battlefield. An Aura with "enchant land," for example, could not be attached to Bruna this way.
2012/05/01: All of these Auras will become attached to Bruna before combat damage is dealt. If Bruna is attacking, these Auras become attached before blockers are declared.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying, first strike
If a source would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, that source deals double that damage to that player or permanent instead.
If a source would deal damage to you or a permanent you control, prevent half that damage, rounded up.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: Gisela doubles damage dealt to opponents and permanents your opponents control from any source, including sources controlled by those opponents.
2018/03/16: If multiple replacement effects would modify how damage would be dealt, the player being dealt damage (or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage) chooses the order in which to apply those effects.
2018/03/16: If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control simultaneously, divide the original amount and double the results. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying, hexproof
Spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause you to sacrifice permanents.</CardText>
<Flavor>Great devotion yields great reward.</Flavor>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent (as Desecration Demon does), you can't take that option.
2018/12/07: If a spell or ability an opponent controls states something happens unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Mogis, God of Slaughter does), you can't choose to sacrifice a permanent. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does), you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since you can't sacrifice any permanents.
2018/12/07: Sigarda's ability affects only sacrifices. It won't stop a creature from dying due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.</Rulings>
