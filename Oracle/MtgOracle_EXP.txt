<Rulings>2015/08/25: Even though these lands have basic land types, they are not basic lands because "basic" doesn't appear on their type line. Notably, controlling two or more of them won't allow others to enter the battlefield untapped.
2015/08/25: However, because these cards have basic land types, effects that specify a basic land type without also specifying that the land be basic can affect them. For example, a spell or ability that reads "Destroy target Forest" can target Canopy Vista, while one that reads "Destroy target basic Forest" cannot.
2015/08/25: If one of these lands enters the battlefield at the same time as any number of basic lands, those other lands are not counted when determining if this land enters the battlefield tapped or untapped.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: <Eye of Ugin> doesn't have a mana ability.
2010/03/01: <Eye of Ugin>'s second ability lets you find any colorless creature card in your deck, such as an artifact creature card that has no colored mana symbols in its mana cost, or a creature card that's become colorless due to Mycosynth Lattice.
2013/04/15: Mistform Ultimus and creatures with changeling are Eldrazi. If they become colorless, possibly due to Mycosynth Lattice, <Eye of Ugin> would reduce the cost to cast them by {2}.</Rulings>
