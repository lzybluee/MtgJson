If you choose X = 2, then Shining Shoal's converted mana cost is 4. Shining Shoal also has an ability that says "You may exile a white card with converted mana cost X from your hand rather than pay Shining Shoal's mana cost"; if you choose to pay the alternative cost and exile a card with converted mana cost 2, then X is 2 while Shining Shoal is on the stack and its converted mana cost is 4.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>89399</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2005/06/01: If the Spirit or Arcane spell has {X} in the mana cost, then you use the value of {X} on the stack. For example, Shining Shoal costs {X}{W}{W}. If you choose X = 2, then Shining Shoal's converted mana cost is 4. Shining Shoal also has an ability that says "You may exile a white card with converted mana cost X from your hand rather than pay Shining Shoal's mana cost"; if you choose to pay the alternative cost and exile a card with converted mana cost 2, then X is 2 while Shining Shoal is on the stack and its converted mana cost is 4.</Rulings>

2005/06/01: If <Erayo, Soratami Ascendant> flips while an opponent's first spell for the turn is still on the stack, the ability of Erayo's Essence doesn't trigger because the opponent's spell has already been cast. The spell isn't countered.
2005/06/01: If you have multiple opponents, Erayo's Essence can trigger once for each opponent.

<Multiverseid>74144</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2005/06/01: <Evermind> is blue in all zones.
2005/06/01: <Evermind> is a blue Arcane instant card. Cards that check whether a card has any of those attributes will affect <Evermind>. For example, you can exile it (as a blue card) to pay the alternative costs of spells like Force of Will and Disrupting Shoal (X = 0). You could search for it with Mystical Tutor because it's an instant or Eerie Procession because it's an Arcane spell.
2006/10/15: If a spell or effect, such as Parallectric Feedback, asks for <Evermind>'s converted mana cost, it's 0.
2006/10/15: <Evermind> has no mana cost, which means it can't normally be cast as a spell. You could, however, cast it via some alternate means, like with Sunforger or Kaho, Minamo Historian.
2013/06/07: You reveal all cards you intend to splice at the same time. Each individual card can be spliced only once onto any one spell.
2013/06/07: A card with a splice ability can't be spliced onto itself because the spell is on the stack (and not in your hand) when you reveal the cards you want to splice onto it.
2013/06/07: You choose all targets for the spell after revealing cards you want to splice, including any targets required by the text of any of those cards. You may choose a different target for each instance of the word "target" on the resulting spell.
2013/06/07: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen.
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

2005/06/01: The other creature's power and toughness are determined as the triggered ability resolves.
2005/06/01: If the other creature has bushido, whether <Shape Stealer> gets the bushido bonus depends on whose turn it is. If <Shape Stealer> is blocking, it won't get the attacker's bushido bonus. If the <Shape Stealer> is being blocked, the bushido ability will resolve just before <Shape Stealer> determines what the creature's power and toughness are.

2009/10/01: You apply power/toughness changing effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (a) effects from characteristic-defining abilities; (b) effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (c) effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (d) changes from counters; (e) effects that switch a creature's power and toughness. This card's effect is always applied in (b), which means that effects applied in sublayer (c), (d), or (e) will not be overwritten; they will be applied to the new value.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/06/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs paid for the targeted spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2005/06/01: <Twincast> copies any text spliced onto the targeted spell, but you can't splice additional text onto the copy.
2009/10/01: <Twincast> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2009/10/01: As <Twincast> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2009/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2009/10/01: If the spell <Twincast> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2009/10/01: If the spell <Twincast> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2009/10/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/06/01: If the Spirit or Arcane spell has {X} in the mana cost, then you use the value of {X} on the stack. For example, Shining Shoal costs {X}{W}{W}. If you choose X = 2, then Shining Shoal's converted mana cost is 4. Shining Shoal also has an ability that says "You may exile a white card with converted mana cost X from your hand rather than pay Shining Shoal's mana cost"; if you choose to pay the alternative cost and exile a card with converted mana cost 2, then X is 2 while Shining Shoal is on the stack and its converted mana cost is 4.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/06/01: You don't need to have seven lands in hand to reveal your hand. You leave your hand revealed until the ability resolves. If you don't have seven or more land cards in your hand at that time, the effect does nothing.
2005/06/01: You don't need to tap Sasaya to use its ability, so you can activate the ability on the turn Sasaya comes under your control.
2005/06/01: Sasaya's Essence has a triggered mana ability. Like activated mana abilities, the triggered mana ability doesn't use the stack.
2005/06/01: The triggered mana ability counts the number of other lands with that same name and adds that much mana to the player's mana pool. The type (that is, the color of mana or colorless mana) is the same as the mana the land just produced.
2005/06/01: If Sasaya's Essence's controller has four Forests and taps one of them for {G}, the Essence will add {G}{G}{G} to that player's mana pool for a total of {G}{G}{G}{G}.
2005/06/01: If Sasaya's Essence's controller has four Mossfire Valley and taps one of them for {R}{G}, the Essence will add three mana (one for each other Mossfire Valley) of any combination of {R} and/or {G} to that player's mana pool.
2005/06/01: If Sasaya's Essence's controller has two Brushlands and taps one of them for {W}, Sasaya's Essence adds another {W} to that player's mana pool. It won't produce {G} or {C} unless the land was tapped for {G} or {C} instead.
2005/06/01: Each Ascendant is legendary in both its unflipped and flipped forms. This means that effects that look for legendary creature cards, such as Time of Need and Captain Sisay, can find an Ascendant.</Rulings>

For example, attempting to deal 9 damage to Sekki causes its replacement effect to 1) prevent the 9 damage, 2) remove all eight of the +1/+1 counters, and 3) put nine Spirit creature tokens onto the battlefield.
2005/06/01: Increasing Sekki's toughness with a card like Indomitable Will allows Sekki to prevent damage and make tokens even it if has no +1/+1 counters to be removed.

2005/06/01: You aren't required to exile Iname. If you don't, the target Spirit card isn't returned to the battlefield.
2013/04/15: In a Commander game, you may send Iname to the Command Zone instead of exiling it during the resolution of its ability. If you do, its ability still works. Iname's ability only requires that you attempted to exile it, not that it actually gets to the exile zone. This is similar to how destroying a creature (with, for example, Rest in Peace) doesn't necessarily ensure that creature will end up in the graveyard; it just so happens that the action of exiling something and the exile zone both use the same word: "exile".
2013/07/01: In a Commander game where this card is your commander, casting it from the Command zone does not count as casting it from your hand.
2013/09/20: If a creature (such as Clone) enters the battlefield as a copy of this creature, the copy's "enters-the-battlefield" ability will still trigger as long as you cast that creature spell from your hand.</Rulings>
