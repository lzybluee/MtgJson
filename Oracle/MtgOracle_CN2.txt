Whenever a creature you control with the chosen name attacks, you may pay {W}. If you do, that creature gains indestructible until end of turn. (Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy it.)</CardText>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The last ability triggers once for each creature with the chosen name that attacks. You choose whether to pay {W} as the ability resolves. Notably, someone could respond to the ability and destroy the creature before it gains indestructible.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda, in which case they begin the game face down.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
2016/08/23: You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, you have only one opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone, as the game begins. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.
2016/08/23: You can look at any player's face-up conspiracies at any time. You'll also know how many face-down conspiracies a player has in the command zone, although you won't know what they are.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy's static and triggered abilities function as long as that conspiracy is face-up in the command zone.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.
2016/08/23: You name the card as the game begins, as you put the conspiracy into the command zone, not as you turn the face-down conspiracy face up.
2016/08/23: There are several ways to secretly name a card, including writing the name on a piece of paper that's kept with the face-down conspiracy. If you have multiple face-down conspiracies, you may name a different card for each one. It's important that each named card is clearly associated with only one of the conspiracies.
2016/08/23: You must name a Magic card. Notably, you can't name a token (except in the unusual case that a token's name matches the name of a card, such as Illusion).
2016/08/23: If you play multiple games after the draft, you can name a different card in each new game.
2016/08/23: As a special action, you may turn a face-down conspiracy face up. You may do so any time you have priority. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Once face up, the named card is revealed and the conspiracy's abilities will affect the game.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy with hidden agenda that has a triggered ability must be face up before that ability's trigger condition is met in order for it to trigger. Turning it face up afterward won't have any effect.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players. Notably, you can't bluff conspiracies with hidden agenda by putting other cards into the command zone face down as the game starts.</Rulings>

<CardText>Hidden agenda (Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly choose a card name. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal that name.)
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, if it targets a creature you control with the chosen name, you may copy that spell and may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416760</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: The instant or sorcery spell can target other things as well, as long as one of its targets is a creature you control with the chosen name.
2016/08/23: When <Echoing Boon>'s ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, before the original spell resolves but after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2016/08/23: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If you can't choose a new legal target for one of the targets, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2016/08/23: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2016/08/23: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Subterranean Tremors has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2016/08/23: If the spell being copied has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2016/08/23: If an alternative cost was paid for the spell being copied, such as a madness cost or surge cost, the same alternative cost is considered to have been paid for the copy.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda, in which case they begin the game face down.

<Artist>Daniel Ljunggren</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416767</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: Even though your starting hand size is five, nothing else about the pregame procedure changes. If you don't take two or more mulligans in a multiplayer game, you won't be able to "scry" before the game starts.
2016/08/23: Unless an effect states otherwise, you are still limited to one land play on each of your turns. Activating the ability of <Sovereign's Realm> multiple times on your turn has no additional benefit.
2016/08/23: In Limited and Constructed events, "outside the game" means your sideboard. In Limited events, your sideboard is considered to have as many cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest as needed. You don't have to draft such cards.
2016/08/23: If you're drafting with other sets and draft basic land cards other than the five mentioned above (including Wastes and the "Snow-Covered" versions of the typical basic lands), those cards will be in your sideboard and the activated ability of <Sovereign's Realm> will allow you to play them. Also, invite me to your next draft—your group sounds rad.
2016/08/23: The ability of <Sovereign's Realm> doesn't change when you can play lands. You can still only play them during your main phase, if the stack is empty, if you have priority, and if you have an available land play.
2016/08/23: You can never play lands on another player's turn. Activating the ability of <Sovereign's Realm> during an opponent's turn won't allow you to play lands that turn.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are never put into your deck. Instead, you put any number of conspiracies from your card pool into the command zone as the game begins. These conspiracies are face up unless they have hidden agenda, in which case they begin the game face down.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
2016/08/23: You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, you have only one opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone, as the game begins. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.

<Artist>Winona Nelson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416772</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: The value of X in the last ability is calculated in a similar fashion to how melee bonuses are calculated. It doesn't matter if the creatures are still attacking or on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the player you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: You determine the size of the bonus as the melee ability resolves. Count each opponent that you attacked with one or more creatures. It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with Wings of the Guard and another player with five creatures, Wings of the Guard will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: Unlike the will of the council cards from the original Conspiracy set, where a majority of votes determined what happened, each vote made for a council's dilemma card adds to the ultimate effect.
2016/08/23: The effects of each council's dilemma ability happen in the stated order. First the vote occurs, then the first effect, and finally the second effect.
2016/08/23: Because the votes are made in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.

2016/08/23: No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The last ability of <Throne Warden> checks to see if you're the monarch as your end step begins. If you're not, the ability won't trigger at all. You won't be able to do anything that would make you the monarch during your end step in time to have that ability trigger. The ability will also check to see if you're the monarch as it tries to resolve. If you're not the monarch at that time, the ability will have no effect.
2016/08/23: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.
2016/08/23: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack, and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: You determine the size of the bonus as the melee ability resolves. Count each opponent that you attacked with one or more creatures. It doesn't matter if the attacking creatures are still attacking or even if they are still on the battlefield. It also doesn't matter if the opponent you attacked is still in the game.
2016/08/23: It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked a player with, only that you attacked a player with at least one creature. For example, if you attack one player with <Wings of the Guard> and another player with five creatures, <Wings of the Guard> will get +2/+2 until end of turn.
2016/08/23: Melee will trigger if the creature with melee attacks a planeswalker. However, the effect counts only opponents (and not planeswalkers) that you attacked with a creature when determining the bonus.
2016/08/23: Creatures that enter the battlefield attacking were never declared as attackers, so they won't count toward melee's effect. Similarly, if a creature with melee enters the battlefield attacking, melee won't trigger.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack a player, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2016/08/23: If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player that goaded it.

If you removed a creature card with flying from the draft with cards named Animus of Predation, Animus of Predation has flying. The same is true for first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, and vigilance.</CardText>
<Artist>Richard Wright</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416817</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: You can remove from the draft any card you draft after <Animus of Predation>.
2016/08/23: If a card you remove requires you to reveal it as you draft it, do so and follow any additional instructions it may have related to drafting it. However, if a card you remove instructs you to draft it face up, it has no effect while face up and can't be turned face down to use an ability.
2016/08/23: Some cards allow you to exile other cards you've drafted that aren't in your deck before the game starts. Cards you removed from the draft with <Animus of Predation> can't be exiled this way because they aren't in your card pool.
2016/08/23: The last ability of <Animus of Predation> functions only if <Animus of Predation> is on the battlefield. For example, <Animus of Predation> is not a creature card with flying in your library or graveyard.</Rulings>

<Artist>Aaron Miller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416836</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/08/23: The set of names the equipped creature has includes the names of all nonlegendary creature cards in the Oracle card reference, including the back faces of double-faced cards. Notably, the equipped creature won't gain the names of tokens, such as Zombie, Goblin, and similar. It also won't gain the names of noncreature cards that have become creatures, such as a Wandering Fumarole that has become a creature.
2016/08/23: If you named any nonlegendary creature card for hidden agenda or draft abilities that refer to a creature on the battlefield, the equipped creature will have that name and will qualify for any relevant bonuses. For example, equipping <Spy Kit> to Noble Banneret will enable Noble Banneret's last ability (as long as you noted a nonlegendary card name for it).
2016/08/23: Some creature cards have abilities that function during the draft and additional abilities that refer to cards you exiled or information you noted with "cards named [this card's name]." These abilities are linked, so equipping <Spy Kit> to such a creature won't affect the set of cards it exiled or the information you noted.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/08/23: The game starts with no monarch. Once an effect makes one player the monarch, the game will have exactly one monarch from that point forward.
2016/08/23: Abilities that trigger whenever you "become the monarch" trigger only if you aren't already the monarch. For example, if you are already the monarch as Custodi Lich enters the battlefield, its last ability won't trigger.
2016/08/23: If the triggered ability that causes the monarch to draw a card goes on the stack, and a different player becomes the monarch before that ability resolves, the first player will still draw the card.</Rulings>

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416841</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/07/01: A permanent card is a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card (instant and sorcery cards aren't permanent cards).
2012/07/01: Permanent cards that were put into your graveyard from anywhere else, such as a card that was discarded, stay in the graveyard. Permanent cards that you gained control of and went to another player's graveyard from the battlefield will likewise stay in the graveyard.
2012/07/01: You choose what an Aura card put onto the battlefield this way will enchant. You can't choose any permanent cards entering the battlefield at the same time as that Aura. If there's nothing legal for the Aura to enchant, it stays in the graveyard.
2012/07/01: Permanent spells that were countered earlier in the turn never entered the battlefield, so they won't return to the battlefield because of <Faith's Reward>.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416844</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card. You don't choose the type of basic land card you'll find until you're performing the search. After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose not to find a basic land card, even if there is one in your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The card is put onto the battlefield, but any effects that check if the original card was "cast from your hand" will not trigger or otherwise consider the card to have been cast from your hand. The card was put onto the battlefield by the effect of <Desertion> instead.
2004/10/04: This spell includes a replacement effect. If the target is an artifact or creature, it never goes to the graveyard.
2004/10/04: If the spell is not countered (because the spell it targets can't be countered), then this card's ability does not put the card onto the battlefield. The spell continues to resolve as normal.</Rulings>

After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card.

After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<CardText>Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, you may search your library for a creature card with the same total power and toughness and put it onto the battlefield. If you do, shuffle your library.</CardText>

<Multiverseid>416953</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If you cast a 2/2 Grizzly Bears, for example, you may then search for any creature with total power and toughness 4. It can be 0/4, 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1.
2007/02/01: The game checks the power and toughness of the creature that just entered the battlefield as it exists on the battlefield. That might mean it's impossible to get another copy of that same card. For example, a Triskelion on the battlefield is 4/4, but a Triskelion in your library is 1/1. The power and toughness might also have been affected while the triggered ability was on the stack (such as with Giant Growth, Sudden Death, or Ovinize).
2007/02/01: If the creature that entered the battlefield has left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, use the power and toughness of that creature as it last appeared before leaving the battlefield.</Rulings>

—Pulan, Bant orchardist</Flavor>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>416976</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Exotic Orchard> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Exotic Orchard>, you can tap <Exotic Orchard> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, <Exotic Orchard> takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an <Exotic Orchard>, and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G}.</Rulings>
