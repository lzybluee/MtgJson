<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>180278</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.
2009/02/01: <Aven Trailblazer>'s second ability is a "characteristic-defining ability." It applies at all times in all zones.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>179505</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card. You don't choose the type of basic land card you'll find until you're performing the search. After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose not to find a basic land card, even if there is one in your library.</Rulings>

At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control a blue permanent, you may create a token that's a copy of Mirror-Sigil Sergeant.</CardText>
<Flavor>"If I had many lives, I would give them all for Bant."</Flavor>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>158598</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The "intervening 'if' clause" means that (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you control a permanent of the specified color, and (2) the ability will do nothing unless you control a permanent of the specified color at the time it resolves.
2009/02/01: Normally, when a token is created by this ability, it will simply be a <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant>, so it'll also have the token-creating ability. (See the other ruling for weird exceptions.) At the beginning of your next upkeep, if you still control the original Sergeant, the token copy, and a blue permanent, you'll get two more token copies; the turn after that you'll get four; then eight; and so on.
2009/02/01: Here's the detailed version of what happens. As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> it's copying — or, if the <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> whose ability triggered was itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant>'s power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2009/02/01: If <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> has left the battlefield by the time its triggered ability resolves, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield. That token has the copiable values of the characteristics of <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> as it last existed on the battlefield.
2009/02/01: Here are the weird exceptions. If any copy effects have affected the <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> whose ability triggered, they're taken into account when the token is created. For example: -- If <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant>'s ability triggers, then <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> temporarily becomes a copy of another creature before its ability resolves (due to Mirrorweave, perhaps), the token will be a copy of whatever creature the <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> is currently a copy of. After the turn ends, the Mirrorweaved <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> reverts back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is. -- If the copy ability of a creature (such as Cemetery Puca, perhaps) makes it become a copy of <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> and gain another ability, the token created by this creature at the beginning of your upkeep will be a <Mirror-Sigil Sergeant> with that additional ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card. You don't choose the type of basic land card you'll find until you're performing the search. After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: You choose the order on the bottom of your library.
2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: <Nyxathid> tracks the hand size of the chosen player even if that player ceases to be an opponent of its controller. (This could happen if that player gains control of <Nyxathid>, for example.)
2009/02/01: In a multiplayer game, if the chosen player leaves the game, <Nyxathid>'s second ability simply won't do anything anymore.
2009/02/01: <Nyxathid>'s two abilities are linked: The second one refers only to the player chosen by the first one. If another creature becomes a copy of <Nyxathid> (due to Mirrorweave, for example), the second ability won't do anything because a player was never chosen as a result of the first ability. This is true even if a different ability allowed a player to be chosen as that creature entered the battlefield.
2009/02/01: If a spell or ability causes the chosen player to draw cards and then discard cards, <Nyxathid>'s power and toughness changes accordingly as that spell or ability is resolving. For example, if the chosen player has five cards in hand and a spell causes that player to draw two cards then discard two cards, <Nyxathid> will start out as 2/2, then become 1/1, 0/0, and finally 2/2. This is because cards are always drawn one at a time, but multiple cards may be discarded at once. Although <Nyxathid> momentarily had 0 toughness while that spell was resolving, it isn't put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action because state-based actions aren't checked until the spell has finished resolving.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.

<Rulings>2009/02/01: When the ability resolves, it gives the +3/+3 bonus to the source of the ability and each other creature that shares a name with that source, even if that source isn't actually named <Cylian Sunsinger>. This could happen if Skill Borrower gains this ability, or if <Cylian Sunsinger>'s name is changed (due to Mirrorweave, perhaps) before the ability resolves.
2009/02/01: If <Cylian Sunsinger> has left the battlefield by the time its ability resolves, its ability will affect each creature whose name is the same as the name <Cylian Sunsinger> had as it last existed on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card.

After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<Multiverseid>189378</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.
2009/02/01: You do what the spell says in order, so you'll put a new basic land card onto the battlefield before you determine the value of X.
2009/02/01: <Exploding Borders> will still deal damage even if you don't put a land card onto the battlefield.
2009/02/01: <Exploding Borders> has only one target: the player. If that player becomes an illegal target by the time <Exploding Borders> would resolve, the entire spell doesn't resolve. You won't get to search for a basic land card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: <Knight of the Reliquary>'s first ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. In all other zones, it's a 2/2 creature.
2017/11/17: The activated ability's cost checks the land's subtype, not its name. You can sacrifice a nonbasic land this way as long as it has the subtype Forest or Plains. Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Horizon Canopy is neither a Forest nor a Plains, while Temple Garden is both.
2017/11/17: Sacrificing a Forest or Plains is part of the cost of <Knight of the Reliquary>'s activated ability. Assuming that sacrificing the land puts it into your graveyard, <Knight of the Reliquary>'s first ability will immediately give it an additional +1/+1 when that cost is paid because there'll be a new land card in your graveyard. Paying a cost can't be responded to (with Shock, for example).
2017/11/17: <Knight of the Reliquary>'s activated ability lets you find any land card, not just a basic land card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: This ability is not optional.
2009/02/01: For a player's life total to become 10, what actually happens is that the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the targeted player's life total is 4 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to gain 6 life; alternately, if the targeted player's life total is 17 when this ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 7 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, this ability basically causes the team's life total to become 10, but only the targeted player is considered to have actually gained or lost life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

<Flavor>"It was a strange morning. When we awoke, we found our trees transformed. We didn't know whether to water them or polish them."
—Pulan, Bant orchardist</Flavor>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>189273</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Exotic Orchard> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Exotic Orchard>, you can tap <Exotic Orchard> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, <Exotic Orchard> takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an <Exotic Orchard>, and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G}.</Rulings>
