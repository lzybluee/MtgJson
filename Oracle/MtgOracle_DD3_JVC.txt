<CardText>Guile can't be blocked except by three or more creatures.
If a spell or ability you control would counter a spell, instead exile that spell and you may play that card without paying its mana cost.
When Guile is put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its owner's library.</CardText>
<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>393841</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: <Guile>'s second ability replaces "counter [a certain spell]" with "exile [a certain spell] and you may cast it without paying its mana cost." You have the option to cast it immediately upon its exile. If you choose not to, it remains exiled and you don't get another chance to cast it. If the spell or ability that tried to counter the spell has additional effects, it then continues to resolve.
2007/10/01: Exiling the spell is mandatory. Casting it is not.
2007/10/01: A spell exiled this way was never actually countered.
2007/10/01: If a spell or ability you control attempts to counter a spell that can't be countered, it doesn't. Since the spell wouldn't be countered, <Guile>'s ability has no effect on it. The spell will continue to resolve normally.
2007/10/01: The last ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into its owner's graveyard from any zone, not just from on the battlefield.
2007/10/01: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it doesn't *specifically* trigger on leaving the battlefield, so it doesn't behave like other leaves-the-battlefield abilities. The ability will trigger from the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>393868</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>Tony Szczudlo</Artist>
<Multiverseid>393822</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Mountaincycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Mountain card. After you find a Mountain card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Mountaincycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Mountaincycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Mountaincycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Mountaincycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Mountaincycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Mountain land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Mountain card in your library.</Rulings>

<Artist>Omar Rayyan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>393843</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: The last ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into its owner's graveyard from any zone, not just from on the battlefield.
2007/10/01: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it doesn't *specifically* trigger on leaving the battlefield, so it doesn't behave like other leaves-the-battlefield abilities. The ability will trigger from the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Flame Javelin> is red even if you spend six green mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Flame Javelin> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {R}{R}{R} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Flame Javelin> by spending {R}{R}{R}, {2}{R}{R}, {4}{R}, or {6}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>
