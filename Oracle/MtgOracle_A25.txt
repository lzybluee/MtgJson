<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2017/04/18: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/04/18: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2017/04/18: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. These cards have the Planeswalker symbol in their text box; this symbol has no effect on gameplay. You can read more about these events in the official Magic fiction at http://www.mtgstory.com.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: While <Rest in Peace> is on the battlefield, abilities that trigger whenever a creature dies won't trigger because cards and tokens are never put into a player's graveyard.

2018/03/16: If a card is discarded while <Rest in Peace> is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>

<Rulings>2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: If you choose not to pay, the creature is sacrificed immediately. No player will get priority in between the creature entering the battlefield and being sacrificed. Sacrificing the creature this way will trigger any abilities that trigger when it leaves the battlefield, and those abilities will be put onto the stack at the same time as those that triggered when it entered the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Alexander Lee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442056</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2018/03/16: If a face-down <Mystic of the Hidden Way> is blocked and then turned face up, it stays blocked.</Rulings>

<Artist>Quinton Hoover</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442066</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: <Vesuvan Shapeshifter>'s ability to become a copy is a replacement effect. Because turning a creature face up and applying replacement effects both don't use the stack, players won't be able to take actions between the time you announce that you're turning <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> face up and the time it has become a copy of the creature of your choice.
2018/03/16: <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2018/03/16: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/03/16: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Vesuvan Shapeshifter>), then <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies whatever the chosen creature copied.
2018/03/16: If the chosen creature is a token, <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is not a token in this case.
2018/03/16: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work as it enters the battlefield. Similarly, any "[when/as] [this creature] is turned face up" abilities of the chosen creature will work if <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is turned face up.
2018/03/16: If <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2018/03/16: When <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is turned face down, its copy effect wears off. While it's face down, it's a 2/2 face-down <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> that can be turned face up for a morph cost of {1}{U}.
2018/03/16: If another creature copies <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> while it's face up and copying another creature, the new creature will become a copy of whatever <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is copying and gain the "you may turn this creature face down" ability. It won't gain morph {1}{U}. If that creature is then turned face down, its copy effect will continue and it'll be a face-down version of whatever it's copying. If the creature it's copying has morph, it can be turned face up. If the creature it's copying doesn't have morph, it's stuck face down.
2018/03/16: If <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies a face-down creature, it becomes a face-up 2/2 colorless, nameless creature with no abilities other than the one it gives itself.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The trigger occurs when you use the Morph ability to turn the card face up, or when an effect turns it face up. It will not trigger on being revealed or on leaving the battlefield.
2013/04/15: If a spell with split second is on the stack, you can still respond by turning this creature face up and targeting that spell with the trigger. This is because split second only stops players from casting spells or activating abilities, while turning a creature face up is a special action.
2018/03/16: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Willbender>'s triggered ability resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s triggered ability, even if all but one of those targets have become illegal.
2018/03/16: If a spell or ability targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with <Willbender>'s ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: If a player discards a card during their cleanup step due to having too many cards in hand, any appropriate abilities that trigger on discarding that card trigger. If this happens, those triggered abilities are put onto the stack and players receive priority in that cleanup step to cast spells or activate abilities (normally, no players may take actions during a cleanup step).

<Artist>Clint Cearley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442096</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: You can choose a mode even if no player will lose the game. Players will still gain or lose life as appropriate.
2018/03/16: If you choose <Triskaidekaphobia>'s second mode and begin to resolve it while an opponent's life total is 13 and your life total is 1, that opponent will lose the game before you lose 1 life.
2018/03/16: If each player has 13 life as <Triskaidekaphobia>'s ability resolves, the game ends in a draw.
2018/03/16: In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team with 13 life loses the game, then each player on each team gains or loses 1 life, causing the team's life total to go up or down by 2.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: If a face-down <Ire Shaman> attacks and is blocked by one creature, turning it face up won't cause it to become unblocked.
2015/02/25: The card exiled with <Ire Shaman>'s last ability is exiled face up.
2015/02/25: Playing the card exiled with <Ire Shaman>'s last ability follows the normal rules for playing the card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2015/02/25: Under normal circumstances, you can play a land card exiled with <Ire Shaman> only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2015/02/25: If you don't play the card, it will remain exiled.
2015/02/25: Turning a face-down creature with megamorph face up and putting a +1/+1 counter on it is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/02/25: If a face-down creature with megamorph is turned face up some other way (for example, if you manifest a card with megamorph and then pay its mana cost to turn it face up), you won't put a +1/+1 counter on it.

2018/03/16: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

2018/03/16: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>442153</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: While playing with the top card of your library revealed, if you draw multiple cards, reveal each one before you draw it. If you put multiple cards on top of your library at once, reveal only the one new top card.
2018/03/16: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you don't reveal the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2018/03/16: <Courser of Kruphix> doesn't change when you can play lands. You can do so only during your main phase when you have priority and the stack is empty.
2018/03/16: Playing a land from the top of your library counts as your land play for the turn. Once you play a land during your turn, you won't be able to play an additional land from the top of your library unless another effect (such as that of Azusa, Lost but Seeking) allows you to.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types it was created with, unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gave it a different name. For example, a 1/1 Cat Soldier creature token is named "Cat Soldier."
2018/03/16: A face-down creature has no name, so it can't share a name with anything. This includes other creatures with no name.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Forestcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Forest card. After you find a Forest card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>

However, if a single creature an opponent controls with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.

<Rulings>2018/03/16: If <Tree of Redemption> isn't on the battlefield when its activated ability resolves, the exchange can't happen and the ability will have no effect.
2018/03/16: When its activated ability resolves, <Tree of Redemption>'s toughness will become your former life total and you will gain or lose an amount of life necessary so that your life total equals <Tree of Redemption>'s former toughness. Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2018/03/16: Any toughness-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will apply after its toughness is set to your former life total. For example, say <Tree of Redemption> is enchanted with Lunarch Mantle (which makes it 2/15) and your life total is 7. After the exchange, <Tree of Redemption> would be a 2/9 creature (its toughness became 7, which was then modified by Lunarch Mantle) and your life total would be 15.</Rulings>

<Artist>Karla Ortiz</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442184</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

This means that it will resolve before Prossh, so any Kobold tokens it creates will be put onto the battlefield before Prossh. If Prossh enters the battlefield without being cast, the ability will not trigger.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so Ruric Thar doesn't have to attack in that case either.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: A mana cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {6} to cast <Chalice of the Void>.
2018/03/16: The number of counters on <Chalice of the Void> matters only at the time the spell is cast. Changing the number of charge counters on <Chalice of the Void> after a spell has been cast won't change whether the ability counters the spell.
2018/03/16: If there are zero charge counters on <Chalice of the Void>, it counters each spell with a converted mana cost of 0. This includes face-down creature spells cast with morph's alternative cost.
2018/03/16: <Chalice of the Void> has to be on the battlefield at the end of casting a spell for the ability to trigger. If you sacrifice <Chalice of the Void> as a cost to cast a spell, its ability can't trigger. However, if it leaves the battlefield once its ability has triggered, that ability will still counter the spell.</Rulings>

<Artist>Noah Bradley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>442221</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
2018/03/16: <Strionic Resonator> targets a triggered ability that has triggered and is on the stack and creates another instance of that ability on the stack. It doesn't cause any object to gain an ability.
2018/03/16: The source of the copy is the same as the source of the original ability.
2018/03/16: If the triggered ability is modal (that is, if it says, "Choose one —" or similar), the mode is copied and can't be changed.
2018/03/16: If the triggered ability divides damage or distributes counters among a number of targets (for example, the ability of Bogardan Hellkite), the division and number of targets can't be changed. If you choose new targets, you must choose the same number of targets.
2018/03/16: Any choices made when the triggered ability resolves won't have been made yet when it's copied. Any such choices will be made separately when the copy resolves. If the triggered ability asks you to pay a cost (such as that of Frenzied Goblin), you pay that cost for the copy.
2018/03/16: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, copies of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by the triggered ability and the copy. For example, if Fiend Hunter's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied and two creatures are exiled, they both return when Fiend Hunter leaves the battlefield.
2018/03/16: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>

<Name>Mishra's Factory</Name>
<Type>Land</Type>
<CardText>{T}: Add {C}.
{1}: Mishra's Factory becomes a 2/2 Assembly-Worker artifact creature until end of turn. It's still a land.
{T}: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.</CardText>

<Rulings>2005/08/01: If another player takes control of the Factory while it is animated, that player keeps control until the control effect ends. They do not lose control just because the card stops being an Assembly-Worker. Note that Auras which steal cards will go to the graveyard if the permanent they enchant is no longer valid.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
2016/06/08: Once turned into a creature, <Mishra's Factory>'s last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.
2016/06/08: If you turn <Mishra's Factory> into a creature but haven't controlled it continuously since your most recent turn began, you won't be able to activate its first or last ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The current power/toughness being 1/1 is a targeting requirement so it is checked when announcing and again right before resolving.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: Once you announce that you're casting a spell or activating an ability, no player may take other actions until the spell or ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to tap your lands to stop you from paying.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: If Blood Moon is on the battlefield and a player controls a face-down <Zoetic Cavern>, it can't be turned face up since it won't have a morph cost.</Rulings>
