<Rulings>2014/09/20: The Warrior token is created before the +1/+1 counter is put on <Herald of Anafenza>.
2014/09/20: The cost to activate a creature's outlast ability includes the tap symbol ({T}). A creature's outlast ability can't be activated unless that creature has been under your control continuously since the beginning of your turn.
2014/09/20: Several creatures with outlast also grant an ability to creatures you control with +1/+1 counters on them, including themselves. These counters could come from an outlast ability, but any +1/+1 counter on the creature will count.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Watermark>Sultai</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: The rules for delve have changed slightly since it was last in an expansion. Previously, delve reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under the current rules, you exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/09/20: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, Dead Drop's converted mana cost is 10 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2014/09/20: You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
2014/09/20: You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than nine cards from your graveyard to cast Dead Drop.
2014/09/20: Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.

2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

Morph {2} (You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for {3}. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)
When Rattleclaw Mystic is turned face up, add {G}{U}{R}.</CardText>

<Watermark>Temur</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Although turning a face-down creature with morph face up doesn't use the stack, <Rattleclaw Mystic>'s triggered ability does use the stack, and players can respond to that ability. Notably, you can't turn <Rattleclaw Mystic> face up while casting a spell or activating an ability. You'll need to turn <Rattleclaw Mystic> face up and have its triggered ability resolve before you can spend that mana.
2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.

<Artist>James Ryman</Artist>
<Watermark>Abzan</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Anafenza's first ability can target any tapped creature you control. That creature doesn't necessarily have to be attacking.
2014/09/20: While Anafenza is on the battlefield, abilities that trigger whenever a nontoken creature your opponent owns dies won't trigger, as that card will never reach that player's graveyard. (Token creatures will still go to the graveyard briefly before ceasing to exist.)
2014/09/20: If your opponent discards a creature card while Anafenza is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.
2014/09/20: Anafenza's last ability cares only what the card would be in the zone it's moving from, not what it would be in the graveyard. For example, if a land card you control becomes a creature due to an effect and then dies, the land card will be exiled. But if a creature card with bestow is an Aura when it would be put into the graveyard, it ends up in the graveyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/09/20: You decide whether to pay {2}{B} as the ability resolves.
2014/09/20: The creature card returned to the battlefield is chosen at random as the ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won't yet know what card will be returned.
2014/09/20: Because the ability doesn't target any creature card, any creature card (including <Kheru Lich Lord> itself) put into the graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to the battlefield.
2014/09/20: The ability that exiles the card at the beginning of your next end step is a delayed triggered ability. If the delayed triggered ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2014/09/20: <Kheru Lich Lord> grants flying, trample, and haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of your next end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2014/09/20: If a creature card returned to the battlefield with <Kheru Lich Lord> would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead. However, if that creature is already being exiled, then the replacement effect won't apply. If the spell or ability that exiles it later returns it to the battlefield (as Suspension Field might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The effects from <Kheru Lich Lord> will no longer apply to it.

2014/09/20: You can't play any land cards exiled with Narset.

<CardText>Whenever Sidisi, Brood Tyrant enters the battlefield or attacks, put the top three cards of your library into your graveyard.
Whenever one or more creature cards are put into your graveyard from your library, create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token.</CardText>

<Watermark>Sultai</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Sidisi's last ability triggers any time creature cards are put into your graveyard from anywhere in your library, not just from the top.
2014/09/20: Any instruction, including Sidisi's first ability, that tells you to put multiple cards from a library into a graveyard moves all the cards at the same time. For example, if Sidisi enters the battlefield and you put three creature cards into your graveyard, Sidisi's last ability will trigger once and you'll put one Zombie token onto the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Artist>Erica Yang</Artist>
<Watermark>Sultai</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: You cast the cards one at a time as <Villainous Wealth> is resolving, choosing modes, targets, and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve. Ignore timing restrictions based on the cards' types. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2014/09/20: Because you're already casting the cards using an alternative cost (by casting them without paying their mana costs), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the cards, including casting them face down using the morph ability. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the cards have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/09/20: If a card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
2014/09/20: Any cards you don't cast this way will remain in exile.</Rulings>

<Watermark>Mardu</Watermark>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: You still choose which player or planeswalker <Zurgo Helmsmasher> attacks.
2014/09/20: If, during your declare attackers step, Zurgo is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having Zurgo attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2014/09/20: If Zurgo enters the battlefield before the combat phase, it will attack that turn if able. If it enters the battlefield after combat, it won't attack that turn and will usually be available to block on the following turn.
2014/09/20: Each time a creature dies, check whether Zurgo had dealt any damage to it at any time during that turn. If so, Zurgo's ability will trigger. It doesn't matter who controlled the creature or whose graveyard it went to.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/09/20: The value of X is determined as the activated ability resolves. If the equipped creature isn't on the battlefield at that time, use its power the last time it was on the battlefield to determine the value of X.
2017/07/14: If the equipped creature's power is negative while resolving the activated ability it gains, X is considered to be 0. (This is a change from previous rulings.)</Rulings>
