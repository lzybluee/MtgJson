<Artist>David Gaillet</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391808</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: <Channel Harm>'s only target is the creature it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you cast <Channel Harm>, not at the time it prevents damage.
2014/11/24: If the target creature is an illegal target as <Channel Harm> tries to resolve, the entire spell doesn't resolve. No damage will be prevented.
2014/11/24: Whether the target creature is still a legal target is not checked after <Channel Harm> resolves. Damage will still be prevented, even if <Channel Harm> can't deal damage to that creature.
2014/11/24: <Channel Harm>'s effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, you may have <Channel Harm> (not the original source) deal damage to the creature as part of that prevention effect. <Channel Harm> is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect the new damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
2014/11/24: You can choose a creature you control as the target. If you do, the damage <Channel Harm> deals to that creature won't be prevented.
2014/11/24: If two players have each cast <Channel Harm> targeting a creature the other controls, and a source one player controls would deal damage to the second player or a permanent that player controls, one <Channel Harm> will prevent that damage and try to deal damage to the creature controlled by the first player. That player's <Channel Harm> will then prevent that damage and try to deal damage to the creature controlled by the second player. This forms a loop that either player can break by choosing to not have <Channel Harm> try to deal damage. It doesn't matter which player breaks the loop, as no damage will be dealt in either case.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.
2014/11/24: You'll still manifest the top card of your library even if the "Form" isn't on the battlefield as its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.
2014/11/24: If you have no cards in your library as the ability resolves, the "Form" will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Casting a noncreature spell will cause both prowess and <Monastery Mentor>'s other ability to trigger. You can put these abilities on the stack in either order. Whichever ability is put on the stack last will resolve first.
2014/11/24: The spell that causes <Monastery Mentor>'s second ability to trigger will not cause the prowess ability of the Monk token that's created to trigger.
2014/11/24: Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
2014/11/24: Prowess triggers only once for any spell, even if that spell has multiple types.
2014/11/24: Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
2014/11/24: Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Artist>Johann Bodin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391926</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: After you activate <Soulfire Grand Master>'s last ability, if the next instant or sorcery spell you cast from your hand doesn't resolve, it won't be put into your hand and the effect won't be applied to the next spell you cast.

2014/11/24: A card's owner is public information at all times.

That player will know which face-down creature they own.

<Artist>Mark Winters</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391884</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The "Khans" ability happens after you draw the card you normally draw during your draw step. That card and the additional card will be in your hand when you have to discard a card.
2014/11/24: The "Dragons" ability adds {2} per spell, not per target. It won't cause a spell to cost more than {2} more to cast, even if that spell targets you and a permanent you control or more than one permanent you control.
2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

<CardText>Exile target creature. Its controller manifests the top card of their library. (That player puts the top card of their library onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. If it's a creature card, it can be turned face up any time for its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391903</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: You can use mana generated by the first ability to pay an alternative cost or an additional cost to cast an artifact spell. It's not limited to paying just that spell's mana cost.
2014/11/24: An activated ability appears in the form "Cost: Effect." Some keywords, including equip, are activated abilities.
2014/11/24: Notably, turning a face-down creature face up isn't an activated ability. If you manifest an artifact creature card or cast an artifact card face down using the morph ability, you can't use mana generated by the first ability to turn it face up.
2014/11/24: The mana generated by the first ability can't be spent to activate abilities of artifact sources that aren't on the battlefield.
2014/11/24: Heart-Piercer Bow is a card from the Khans of Tarkir set. Vial of Dragonfire doesn't appear to have been invented yet. Curious.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: If the same player controls both permanents when <Shifting Loyalties> resolves, nothing happens.

You could, however, change just the second target to a creature controlled by a different opponent. The two new targets can share a different card type than the two original targets did.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: <Will of the Naga> can target creatures that are already tapped. Those creatures won't untap during their controller's next untap step.
2014/11/24: <Will of the Naga> tracks the creatures, but not their controllers. If any of those creatures changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
2014/11/24: If you chose two targets and one is an illegal target as <Will of the Naga> resolves, that creature won't become tapped and it won't be stopped from untapping during its controller's next untap step. It won't be affected by <Will of the Naga> in any way.
2014/11/24: You exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/11/24: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Tasigur's Cruelty (with mana cost {5}{B}) is 6 even if you exile three cards to cast it.
2014/11/24: You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
2014/11/24: You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than five cards from your graveyard to cast Tasigur's Cruelty.
2014/11/24: Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: You'll choose how each creature controlled by an opponent blocks, even if that creature wasn't on the battlefield or wasn't controlled by an opponent as the activated ability resolved.
2014/11/24: In a multiplayer game, if more than one player activates <Brutal Hordechief>'s activated ability on the same turn, the controller of the last ability to resolve will choose how any creatures controlled by players who didn't resolve this ability will block.

For example, if <Brutal Hordechief> attacked one opponent and two other creatures you control attacked another opponent, the first opponent would lose 1 life and the second opponent would lose 2 life.

<Artist>YW Tang</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391843</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The pile is shuffled to disguise from your opponents which manifested creature is which. After you manifest the cards, you can look at them.
2014/11/24: If you manifest a card owned by an opponent and you leave the game, that card is exiled.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

For example, exiling a Battle Brawler (a creature with "As long as you control a red or white permanent, Battle Brawler gets +1/+0 and has first strike") with <Soulflayer>'s delve ability won't cause <Soulflayer> to have first strike, even if you control a red or white permanent.
2014/11/24: You can't exile more cards from your graveyard than you'd need to pay <Soulflayer>'s generic mana requirement. In most situations, this means you can't exile more than four cards, even if you want to exile more to give it extra abilities.

For example, if a 3/3 creature is targeted by <Arcbond> and later in the turn it blocks a 7/7 creature, the 3/3 creature will deal 7 damage each other creature and each player.
2014/11/24: Damage dealt by the creature because of the ability <Arcbond> creates isn't combat damage, even if it was combat damage that caused the ability to trigger.
2014/11/24: If two <Arcbond>s have resolved targeting different creatures, and damage is dealt to one of them, the delayed triggered ability will cause that creature to deal damage to each other creature and player. This will cause the delayed triggered ability from the other <Arcbond> to trigger. The second creature will then deal damage to each other creature and player. This will continue until one or both of the creatures die or the game ends. If this doesn't happen (perhaps because both creatures have indestructible and damage dealt to the players is being prevented), and no player breaks the loop, the game will be a draw.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Even though it can generate mana, <Dragonrage> isn't a mana ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2014/11/24: Only creatures that are attacking as <Dragonrage> resolves will count toward how much mana is generated, and only those creatures will gain the "firebreathing" activated ability. In other words, casting <Dragonrage> before you've declared attackers usually won't do anything.
2014/11/24: Remember that unused mana empties from players' mana pools at the end of each step and phase. For example, if you cast <Dragonrage> during your declare attackers step, except in very rare cases, the mana <Dragonrage> generates won't last until the declare blockers step or the postcombat main phase.</Rulings>

<Artist>Tyler Jacobson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391832</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>391833</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: You choose which opponent or opposing planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker <Flamerush Rider> is attacking.
2014/11/24: Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2014/11/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it doesn't copy any effects that may have turned a noncreature permanent into a creature. If the token isn't a creature as it enters the battlefield, it won't be attacking.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Flamerush Rider> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2014/11/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2014/11/24: If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, you won't exile that creature at end of combat. However, if <Flamerush Rider> creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you'll exile each of those tokens.
2014/11/24: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2014/11/24: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2014/11/24: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
2014/11/24: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.</Rulings>

Additionally, the ability will check to see if you control a creature with power 4 or greater again as it resolves. If you don't, the ability will have no effect.
2014/11/24: You still choose which player or planeswalker <Flamewake Phoenix> attacks.
2014/11/24: If, during your declare attackers step, <Flamewake Phoenix> is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having <Flamewake Phoenix> attack, you're not forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

2014/11/24: If you exile a land card using the "Khans" ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/11/24: If a noncreature card is manifested and then leaves the battlefield while face down, the "Dragons" ability will trigger.
2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept.

Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.

If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege.

2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.
2014/11/24: You'll still manifest the top card of your library even if the "Form" isn't on the battlefield as its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.
2014/11/24: If you have no cards in your library as the ability resolves, the "Form" will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/11/24: If the enchanted creature is turned face up, the "Form" will continue to enchant it.</Rulings>

You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.

<Multiverseid>391792</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: <Arashin War Beast>'s ability will trigger only once per combat damage step, no matter how many creatures are blocking it.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this.

2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>391943</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Flavor>The energies of the Temur lands are readily unleashed upon intruders.</Flavor>
<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>
<Multiverseid>391828</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The cards are manifested one at a time. It must remain clear which face-down creature was the top card of your library and which one was the second card of your library.
2014/11/24: If you're playing with the top card of your library revealed as <Ethereal Ambush> resolves (perhaps because you control a card such as Courser of Kruphix), you'll manifest the top card, reveal the next card (now the top card), and then manifest that card.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2014/11/24: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2014/11/24: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
