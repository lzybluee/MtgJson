<Rulings>2010/03/01: The cards you put into your hand this way include one nonland card, plus all the land cards on top of it in your library (if any). If the top card of your library is a nonland card, you just get that one.
2010/03/01: If all the cards left in your library are lands, you'll reveal all of them and put them all into your hand.</Rulings>

<CardText>Electrolyze deals 2 damage divided as you choose among one or two targets.
Draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Karl Kopinski</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: You divide the damage as you cast <Electrolyze>, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. In other words, as you cast <Electrolyze>, you choose whether to have it deal 2 damage to a single target, or deal 1 damage to each of two targets.
2017/11/17: If <Electrolyze> targets two creatures and one becomes an illegal target, the remaining target is dealt 1 damage, not 2. You'll still draw a card.
2017/11/17: If all chosen targets are illegal as <Electrolyze> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt and you won't draw a card.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: Whether you control two or more Vampires is checked only as you try to move <Feast of Blood> to the stack as the first step of casting it. It doesn't matter whether you still control two or more Vampires as you finish casting <Feast of Blood> (in case you somehow sacrifice one to produce mana) or as <Feast of Blood> resolves.
2009/10/01: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Feast of Blood> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. You don't gain life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: It only works once. If someone casts another spell after it triggers, but before that trigger resolves, then it will trigger again. The first time one of these triggers resolves, it will be sacrificed for the full effect. Any additional triggers on the stack will do nothing when they resolve because you will be unable to sacrifice it additional times.</Rulings>
