<Rulings>2010/06/15: A colored permanent is a permanent with at least one colored mana symbol in its mana cost. Note that effects may cause a colored permanent to become colorless (as Moonlace could), or a colorless permanent to become colored (as Crimson Wisps could).
2010/06/15: Tokens may also be colored permanents. The effect that creates a token states what color it is or whether it's colorless.
2010/06/15: Lands have no mana cost, so they are colorless unless an effect states otherwise.
2010/06/15: All the colored permanents are sacrificed at the same time.
2013/07/01: <All Is Dust> doesn't destroy permanents. Rather, it causes them to be sacrificed. Regeneration, totem armor, and indestructibile can't save permanents from <All Is Dust>.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before they declare blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
2010/06/15: Emrakul can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Lay Bare). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2010/06/15: "Protection from colored spells" means that Emrakul can't be the target of colored spells (including colored Aura spells) or of abilities whose sources are colored spells (such as the "when you cast" ability of an Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre that's been turned red by Painter's Servant). It also means that all damage that would be dealt to Emrakul by colored spells is prevented. Like every protection ability, it works only while Emrakul is on the battlefield.
2010/06/15: "Colored spells" is not synonymous with "colored instants and sorceries." For example, if a player cycles Choking Tethers, its triggered ability may target Emrakul because Choking Tethers wasn't cast as a spell.
2010/06/15: Emrakul may be affected by colored spells that don't target it or deal damage to it, including those that cause it to become blocked. Abilities of colored permanents (such as Journey to Nowhere) may target it. Auras may be moved onto it by abilities or by colored spells that don't target it (such as Aura Graft).</Rulings>

2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
2010/06/15: The second ability triggers whenever an opponent sacrifices a nontoken permanent for any reason, not just due to the annihilator ability.
2010/06/15: It doesn't matter whose graveyard the permanent is put into, only that it was last controlled by, and sacrificed by, an opponent.
2010/06/15: If an opponent sacrifices a nontoken permanent as part of paying the cost of a spell or ability, the second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it. This ability will resolve, causing you to return the card to the battlefield before the other spell or ability resolves.
2010/06/15: When the second ability resolves, you must return the card to the battlefield, even if you don't want to.
2010/06/15: If an opponent sacrifices an Aura, you'll choose what it enchants as you return it to the battlefield. No player can respond to the choice. Since an Aura doesn't target anything if it isn't cast as a spell, you can enchant a permanent with shroud this way.
2010/06/15: If the sacrificed permanent that caused the second ability to trigger somehow leaves the graveyard before the ability resolves (possibly because it was returned to the battlefield by the ability of another <It That Betrays>), the ability simply won't do anything when it resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The spell or ability you target with <Not of This World> may have any number of targets, as long as one of them is a permanent you control.
2010/06/15: <Not of This World>'s first ability checks the current state of the targets of the spell or ability it's targeting to determine whether one of them is a permanent you control. For example, say a player casts Forked Bolt targeting you and a creature you control. If, in response, another spell or ability causes that creature to no longer be under your control, then you can't cast <Not of This World> targeting Forked Bolt. Alternately, if you cast <Not of This World> targeting Forked Bolt and, in response, another spell or ability causes that creature to no longer be under your control, <Not of This World> won't resolve when it tries to resolve for having an illegal target.
2010/06/15: <Not of This World>'s second ability checks the current state of the targets of the spell or ability it's targeting to determine whether one of them is a creature you control with power 7 or greater. This check is made as you cast <Not of This World>, before you activate mana abilities. It doesn't matter what the power of the creature was at the time the targeted spell or ability was cast.
2010/06/15: <Not of This World> doesn't check whether the targets of the spell or ability it's targeting are currently legal for that spell or ability, only who controls them and what their power is. For example, say a player casts Forked Bolt targeting you and a creature you control. If, in response, another spell or ability causes that creature to gain shroud, then you can still cast <Not of This World> targeting Forked Bolt.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability targets you, but not a permanent you control, you can't cast <Not of This World> targeting it.</Rulings>

Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law). You cast all of the cards you like, putting them onto the stack, then the ability finishes resolving. The spells you cast this way will then resolve as normal, one at a time, in the opposite order that they were put on the stack. They'll remain in the game for the remainder of that game.
2010/06/15: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. On the other hand, if the card has additional costs, you may pay those.
2010/06/15: In a casual game, the cards you cast from outside the game come from your personal collection. In a sanctioned event, those cards must come from your sideboard. Note that you can't cast cards from exile this way; exile is a zone in the game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>194949</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: You choose the color as <Emerge Unscathed> resolves. Once you choose a color, it's too late for players to respond.</Rulings>

<Artist>Aleksi Briclot</Artist>
<Multiverseid>192218</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. That's because the effect states a true thing about a set of creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, whatever creatures the targeted opponent controls during the declare attackers step of their next turn must attack <Gideon Jura> if able. This includes creatures that come under that player's control after the ability has resolved and creatures that have lost all abilities.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability causes creatures to attack him if able. If, during the affected player's declare attackers step, a creature they control is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2010/06/15: If a creature controlled by the affected player can't attack <Gideon Jura> (because he's no longer on the battlefield, for example), that player may have it attack you, another one of your planeswalkers, or nothing at all.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s first ability applies during each combat phase of the affected player's next turn (as opposed to applying during the affected player's next combat phase). The distinction is relevant if there are no combat phases during that turn (due to Fatespinner's effect, for example) or there are multiples (due to World at War, for example).
2010/06/15: If <Gideon Jura> becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. <Gideon Jura> was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/06/15: If <Gideon Jura> becomes a creature, he may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any) unless he began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when <Gideon Jura> came under your control, not when he became a creature.
2010/06/15: <Gideon Jura>'s third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2010/06/15: If you activate <Gideon Jura>'s third ability and then unpreventable damage is dealt to him (due to Unstable Footing, for example), that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on <Gideon Jura> (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If the total amount of damage marked on <Gideon Jura> is lethal damage, he's destroyed as a state-based action. If <Gideon Jura> has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2010/06/15: Say you activate <Gideon Jura>'s third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack <Gideon Jura> (since he's still a planeswalker). Then <Gideon Jura> may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him! During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.
2011/01/22: The first ability only affects the declaration of attackers. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking (thanks to Hero of Bladehold, Preeminent Captain, or the Ninjutsu ability, for example), that creature's controller may choose the defending player or planeswalker that it will be attacking in the normal way.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.
2010/06/15: The prevention effects prevent 1 or 2 damage, as applicable, from each source (regardless of who controls it) each time that source would deal damage to you or a creature you control. They prevent damage of any kind, not just combat damage.
2010/06/15: Remember that <Hedron-Field Purists> never has both of these prevention effects at the same time.
2010/06/15: If a source would deal damage to multiple applicable recipients, the prevention effects apply to each of those recipients separately. For example, if <Hedron-Field Purists> is level 1 and you cast Earthquake ("Earthquake deals X damage to each creature without flying and each player") with X equal to 3, that Earthquake will deal 2 damage to you, 2 damage to each creature without flying you control, 3 damage to each other player, and 3 damage to each creature without flying other players control.
2010/06/15: The prevention effects don't affect damage dealt directly to a planeswalker you control.
2010/06/15: The effects from multiple <Hedron-Field Purists> are cumulative.</Rulings>

Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>198294</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: Which creatures are dealt damage is based on which creatures were declared as attackers during the declare attackers step.
2010/06/15: How much damage each of those creatures is dealt is based how many creatures are attacking at the time the ability resolves.
2010/06/15: For example: If a creature attacks but is removed from combat before <Lightmine Field>'s ability resolves (because it would be destroyed and regenerates, perhaps), that creature is dealt damage by <Lightmine Field> but isn't counted when determining the amount of damage. On the other hand, if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking (due to Preeminent Captain's ability, perhaps), it isn't dealt damage by <Lightmine Field>, but it is counted when determining the amount of damage.</Rulings>

Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193541</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

<Artist>Erica Yang</Artist>
<Multiverseid>198180</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, anything that cares about your life total checks the life total of your team. For example, say that your team has 10 life and your opponent's team has 11 life when you cast <Survival Cache>. You'll gain 2 life, so your team's life total becomes 12. Since your life total (12) is greater than an opponent's life total (11), you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.
2013/07/01: Lethal damage and effects that say "destroy" won't cause a creature with indestructible to be put into the graveyard. However, a creature with indestructible can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary creature with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193416</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2010/06/15: All _Rise of the Eldrazi_ cards printed with totem armor are Auras with "enchant creature." But <Umbra Mystic> grants totem armor to Auras attached to any permanent you control, not just creatures. The ability works the same way even if the Aura is enchanting a land, an artifact, or any other permanent.
2010/06/15: <Umbra Mystic> grants totem armor to Auras attached to permanents you control, regardless of who controls those Auras. Conversely, it doesn't grant totem armor to Auras you control that are attached to permanents controlled by other players.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control would be destroyed, and it's enchanted by an Aura with totem armor, it doesn't matter who controls that Aura. The totem armor effect is mandatory. If that permanent is enchanted by multiple Auras, you choose which one is destroyed, regardless of who controls them.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent that's enchanted by an Aura you control, and that Aura is itself enchanted by an Aura. If the permanent would be destroyed, instead the first Aura is destroyed... but since that Aura would be destroyed, instead the second Aura is destroyed.
2010/06/15: Multiple instances of totem armor on the same Aura are redundant.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: You may target any Aura you control, and you may target any creature (including one you don't control). Whether the Aura could legally enchant the creature is irrelevant as you're choosing the targets.
2010/06/15: If you target an Aura that's attached to a creature, you may also target the creature it's attached to. <Aura Finesse> won't cause the Aura to move, but you'll still draw a card when it resolves.
2010/06/15: As <Aura Finesse> resolves, if the targeted Aura can't legally enchant the targeted creature (for example, because the Aura is red and the creature has protection from red, or because the Aura has "enchant creature you control" and an opponent controls the creature), the spell resolves but the Aura doesn't move. You still draw a card.
2010/06/15: As <Aura Finesse> resolves, if either target is illegal, the spell resolves but the Aura doesn't move. You still draw a card. If both targets are illegal, <Aura Finesse> doesn't resolve and you don't draw a card.
2010/06/15: You still control the Aura, even if you attach it to a creature you don't control.</Rulings>

<CardText>Instant and sorcery spells you control have rebound. (Exile the spell as it resolves if you cast it from your hand. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast that card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>198301</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: Multiple instances of rebound on the same spell are redundant.
2010/06/15: The rebound effect is not optional. Each instant and sorcery spell you cast from your hand is exiled instead of being put into your graveyard as it resolves, whether you want it to be or not. Casting the spell during your next upkeep is optional, however.
2010/06/15: If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Arc Blade, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply.
2010/06/15: If a spell you cast from your hand has both rebound and buyback (and the buyback cost was paid), you choose which effect to apply as it resolves.
2010/06/15: You'll be able to cast a spell with flashback three times this way. First you can cast it from your hand. It will be exiled due to rebound as it resolves. Then you can cast it from exile due to rebound's delayed triggered ability. It will be put into your graveyard as it resolves. Then you can cast it from your graveyard due to flashback. It will be exiled due to flashback as it resolves.
2010/06/15: For the rebound effect to happen, <Cast Through Time> needs to be on the battlefield as the spell _finishes_ resolving. For example, if you cast Warp World from your hand, and as part of its resolution it puts <Cast Through Time> onto the battlefield, Warp World will rebound. Conversely, if Warp World shuffles your <Cast Through Time> into your library as part of its resolution, and doesn't put another one onto the battlefield, it will not rebound.
2010/06/15: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand and it's exiled due to rebound, the delayed triggered ability will allow you to cast it during your next upkeep even if <Cast Through Time> has left the battlefield by then.
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. Any X in the mana cost will be 0. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Momentous Fall does), you must pay those if you choose to cast the card.
2010/06/15: If a spell has restrictions on when it can be cast (for example, "Cast [this spell] only during the declare blockers step"), those restrictions may prevent you from casting it from exile during your upkeep.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell using the madness or suspend abilities, you're casting it from exile, not from your hand. Although those spells will have rebound, the ability won't have any effect.
2010/06/15: Similarly, if you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell with Commandeer, it will have rebound, but the ability won't do anything because that spell wasn't cast from your hand.</Rulings>

The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.

(This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2010/06/15: Only <Crab Umbra>'s controller (who is not necessarily the enchanted creature's controller) can activate its activated ability.
2010/06/15: When <Crab Umbra>'s activated ability resolves, it will untap the creature <Crab Umbra> is enchanting at that time (regardless of what creature <Crab Umbra> was enchanting when the ability was activated). If <Crab Umbra> has left the battlefield by then, the ability will untap the creature it was enchanting at the time it left the battlefield.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.

2010/06/15: <Dormant Gomazoa>'s last ability won't trigger when you become the target of an ability.
2010/06/15: If you become the target of a spell, <Dormant Gomazoa>'s last ability triggers and is put on the stack on top of that spell. <Dormant Gomazoa>'s last ability will resolve (allowing you to untap it) first.</Rulings>

Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193635</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.
2010/06/15: <Echo Mage>'s last two activated abilities can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2010/06/15: When either ability resolves, it creates a copy (or two) of a spell. The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. Each copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. Each copy resolves before the original spell does.
2010/06/15: Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2010/06/15: If you activate <Echo Mage>'s last ability to copy a spell twice, you may choose new targets for each copy independently. They don't have to have the same targets as one another. Be sure to specify which of the copies will resolve first.
2010/06/15: If the spell the ability copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), each copy will have the same mode as the original spell. You can't choose a different one.
2010/06/15: If the spell the ability copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), each copy has the same value of X as the original spell.
2010/06/15: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for a copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for each copy too.
2010/06/15: If a copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of that copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if a copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of that copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: In a two-player game, if you have a level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist> and there are no other extra-turn effects, the game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): your turn, your opponent's turn, [your turn], your turn, your opponent's turn, [your turn], your turn, your opponent's turn, and so on.
2010/06/15: In a four-player game, if you have a level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist> and there are no other extra-turn effects, the game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): your turn, opponent A's turn, [your turn], opponent B's turn, [your turn], opponent C's turn, [your turn], your turn, opponent A's turn, and so on. The same principle applies to a multiplayer game with a different number of players.
2010/06/15: The effects of multiple level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist>s are cumulative. If you control two of them in a two-player game, you'll take three turns for each turn your opponent takes.
2010/06/15: In a two-player game, if you and your opponent each control a level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist>, they'll essentially cancel each other out and you'll alternate turns. Since all the turns you'd be taking are extra turns created by these abilities, make sure you know whose normal turn is supposed to be next in case one or both of the <Lighthouse Chronologist>s leaves the battlefield.
2010/06/15: In a multiplayer game, if multiple players each control a level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist>, extra turns may sometimes be created faster than they can be taken. Keep track of them carefully. If multiple Chronologist's abilities trigger during the same turn, the player whose turn would show up sooner in the natural turn order will get the first extra turn. For example, say Players B and C each control a level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist>. Player A takes a turn. The game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): Player A's current turn, [Player B's turn], [Player C's turn], [Player B's turn], [Player C's turn], and so on. Because Players B and C will each add another extra turn after the other player's extra turn, Player A will not take another turn as long as both level 7 <Lighthouse Chronologist>s remain on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>193594</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: <Narcolepsy>'s triggered ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability triggers only if the enchanted creature is untapped as any player's upkeep begins, and (2) the ability does nothing if the enchanted creature is already tapped by the time it resolves.
2010/06/15: <Narcolepsy> doesn't keep the enchanted creature continually tapped. The creature untaps during its controller's untap step as normal, then is tapped when <Narcolepsy>'s ability resolves during that upkeep. The creature may be tapped in response (for example, if it has an activated ability with {T} in its cost).</Rulings>

<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>194936</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may have Renegade Doppelganger become a copy of that creature until end of turn. (If it does, it loses this ability for the rest of the turn.)</CardText>
<Flavor>To truly know a creature, slither a mile in its tentacles.</Flavor>
<Artist>James Ryman</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193582</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: When a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you can choose not to copy it. In that case, <Renegade Doppelganger> remains 0/1 and still has its triggered ability.
2010/06/15: If <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of another creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. <Renegade Doppelganger> was already on the battlefield; it only changed its characteristics. If <Renegade Doppelganger> gains any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities, they won't do anything. The same is true of any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities.
2010/06/15: If <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of another creature, it copies exactly what was printed on that card and nothing more (unless that card is copying something else or it's a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether the original creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or whether it's been affected by any noncopy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2010/06/15: If <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of a creature that is itself copying something else (for example, if the creature that entered the battlefield is a Clone), then <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
2010/06/15: If <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of a token, <Renegade Doppelganger> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. <Renegade Doppelganger> doesn't become a token.
2010/06/15: Noncopy effects that have already applied to <Renegade Doppelganger> will continue to apply to it after it becomes a copy of something else. For example, if Giant Growth had given it +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then it becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 creature), it will be a 5/5 Runeclaw Bear.
2010/06/15: During the cleanup step, <Renegade Doppelganger>'s copy effect wears off. It will go back to being a 0/1 blue creature named <Renegade Doppelganger>, and will have its original ability again. Note that this happens at the same time that damage marked on the <Renegade Doppelganger> is removed. If it was dealt damage earlier in the turn, this damage will not cause <Renegade Doppelganger> to be destroyed when its copy effect wears off.
2010/06/15: If a creature enters the battlefield under your control and <Renegade Doppelganger>'s ability triggers, it can become a copy of that creature when the ability resolves even if that creature has left the battlefield by then. If it has, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see what it was (specifically, if it was itself or if it was copying something else).
2010/06/15: <Renegade Doppelganger>'s ability isn't targeted. It can copy a creature with shroud or protection.
2010/06/15: If the creature <Renegade Doppelganger> copies has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger and resolve before <Renegade Doppelganger>'s copy effect wears off.
2010/06/15: If <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of a creature with an ability that causes you to make a choice (such as naming a card or choosing a color) as it enters the battlefield, and another ability that refers to that choice, those abilities of the Doppelganger won't do anything. You won't have the chance to make a choice since the Doppelganger is already on the battlefield, so the value of that choice is undefined.
2010/06/15: If <Renegade Doppelganger> and another creature enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, <Renegade Doppelganger>'s ability will trigger. When the ability resolves, <Renegade Doppelganger> can become a copy of that creature.
2010/06/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, <Renegade Doppelganger>'s ability will trigger once for each of them. You choose the order that those abilities will resolve. It's possible to have <Renegade Doppelganger> become a copy of something, activate an activated ability of that creature, then have it become a copy of something else under this scenario. The last ability that resolves that you choose to use determines what it ends up a copy of.
2013/07/01: If <Renegade Doppelganger> becomes a copy of a legendary creature, you will have to put one of them into the graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Ryman</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193490</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: <Training Grounds> won't affect a cost that isn't the cost to activate a creature's activated ability. For example, it won't affect Flameblast Dragon's {X}{R} cost, since that's a cost paid when a triggered ability resolves, and it won't affect a kicker cost, since that's an additional cost to cast a spell. Activated ability costs appear before a colon (:) in a card's rules text, or, in the case of some keywords, before a colon in reminder text.
2010/06/15: <Training Grounds> affects only creatures you control on the battlefield. The costs of activated abilities that work in other zones (such as cycling or unearth) won't be reduced.
2010/06/15: <Training Grounds> won't affect the part of an activation cost represented by colored mana symbols or snow mana symbols. It also won't affect nonmana parts of an activation cost, if there are any.
2010/06/15: <Training Grounds> can reduce the part of an activation cost represented by generic mana symbols down to nothing, as long as it still costs at least one mana. For example, if an activation cost is {2}{G}, you'd have to pay only {G}. If an activation cost is {2}, though, you'd still have to pay {1}.
2010/06/15: <Training Grounds> can reduce the amount you pay for a creature's activated ability cost that includes {X}. For example, Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief has an activated ability that costs {X}{B}{B}. If you control <Training Grounds> and you activate the ability with X equal to 5, you'll have to pay only {3}{B}{B}. This is true even if the ability states that {X} must be paid with a certain color of mana, as Crimson Hellkite's ability does.
2010/06/15: If an activated ability of a creature you control costs no generic mana to activate (for example, if it costs {R}{R}, it costs {0}, or it costs only nonmana actions such as {T} or "Sacrifice a creature"), <Training Grounds> simply won't affect it. In particular, it won't increase the cost to include a mana payment of {1}.
2010/06/15: <Training Grounds> takes the total cost to activate a creature's activated ability into account, not just the cost printed on it. For example, Furnace Spirit has an activated ability that costs {R}, and Suppression Field says "Activated abilities cost {2} more to activate unless they're mana abilities." Since activating Furnace Spirit's activated ability would now cost {2}{R}, <Training Grounds> reduces that cost back to {R}.
2010/06/15: You may choose not to apply Training Ground's cost reduction effect. You may also choose to apply only part of it (causing an activated ability of a creature you control to cost just {1} less to activate).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The power of the other creature is checked only when it blocks or becomes blocked by <Arrogant Bloodlord>. Once the Bloodlord's ability triggers, it will be destroyed at end of combat (after combat damage has been dealt) even if the other creature's power changes before then.
2010/06/15: If <Arrogant Bloodlord> blocks or becomes blocked by a creature whose power is 2 or greater, <Arrogant Bloodlord>'s ability won't trigger. It still won't trigger if the other creature's power changes to 1 or less later in combat.
2010/06/15: If <Arrogant Bloodlord> becomes blocked by multiple creatures with power 1 or less, its ability triggers that many times. Each of those abilities will cause it to be destroyed separately (in case <Arrogant Bloodlord> isn't destroyed the first time due to an Aura with totem armor, for example). The same is true if it somehow blocks multiple creatures with power 1 or less.</Rulings>

<Artist>Trevor Claxton</Artist>
<Multiverseid>205936</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: The sacrificed creature's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its toughness.
2010/06/15: If the targeted player doesn't sacrifice a creature (because the player didn't control any creatures or due to Tajuru Preserver, perhaps), you gain no life.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: On the other hand, the enchanted land's controller may tap the land for mana, let <Contaminated Ground>'s ability trigger and go on the stack, then spend that mana to cast an instant or activate an ability in response. In that case, that instant or ability will resolve first.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: You cast nonland cards from exile as part of the resolution of <Hellcarver Demon>'s ability. You may cast those cards in any order. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only before the combat damage step"). You cast all of the cards you like, putting them onto the stack, then <Hellcarver Demon>'s ability finishes resolving. The spells you cast this way will then resolve as normal, one at a time, in the opposite order that they were put on the stack.
2010/06/15: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Momentous Fall does), you must pay those when you cast the card.
2010/06/15: Any cards you can't cast (because they're lands or they have no legal targets, perhaps) or choose not to cast simply remain exiled.
2010/06/15: If you control two <Hellcarver Demon>s that deal combat damage to a player at the same time, each Demon's ability triggers. When the first one resolves, you'll sacrifice all permanents except that <Hellcarver Demon> (meaning you'll sacrifice the other one). Then you'll exile six cards from your library and may cast nonland cards exiled that way. After those spells resolve, the other Demon's ability resolves. You'll sacrifice all permanents you now control (including the first Demon and any permanents put on the battlefield as a result of the spells you just cast), exile six more cards from your library, and cast any number of them.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

<Artist>Vance Kovacs</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193657</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: For a player's life total to become a certain number that's lower than their current life total, what actually happens is that the player loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the lowest life total in the game is 5 and another player has 12 life, <Repay in Kind> will cause that player to lose 7 life. Abilities that interact with life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, anything that cares about a player's life total checks the life total of that player's team. In addition, if an effect would cause the life total of each member of a team to become a certain number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected, then the life total change is applied to the entire team. For example, if one team has 13 life and another team has 21 life, the team with the higher life total chooses one of its members and <Repay in Kind> causes that player to lose 8 life, thus causing that team's life total to also be 13.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: If the targeted player becomes an illegal target by the time <Suffer the Past> resolves but the targeted cards don't, you still exile the cards and gain life. The player won't be lose any life, though.

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193455</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: As <Thought Gorger>'s first ability resolves, putting a +1/+1 counter on it for each card in your hand is mandatory. The effect says "if you do" because performing that action might be impossible. If <Thought Gorger> has left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can't put any +1/+1 counters on it, so you won't discard your hand.
2010/06/15: When <Thought Gorger>'s second ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see how many +1/+1 counters it had on it. All of them are counted, not just the ones put on it by its enters-the-battlefield ability.
2010/06/15: Once an ability starts to resolve, it's too late to respond to it. For example, you can't count a card in your hand while determining how many +1/+1 counters <Thought Gorger> gets and then cast it in response. If a card is counted, it'll be discarded.</Rulings>

Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>198298</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

<Artist>Goran Josic</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193474</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: <Splinter Twin> grants an activated ability to the enchanted creature. That creature's controller (who is not necessarily the Aura's controller) can activate it. The creature's controller is the player who gets the token.
2010/06/15: The token that's put onto the battlefield copies exactly what's printed on the enchanted creature (unless that creature is copying something else or it's a token; see below), plus it has haste. It doesn't copy whether the enchanted creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or whether it's been affected by any noncopy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. In particular, it doesn't copy the ability granted to the enchanted creature by <Splinter Twin>.
2010/06/15: If the enchanted creature is copying something else when the ability resolves (for example, if it's a Renegade Doppelganger), then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever the enchanted creature is copying, plus it has haste.
2010/06/15: If the enchanted creature is a token, the new token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield, plus it has haste.
2010/06/15: If the enchanted creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2010/06/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the enchanted creature will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the enchanted creature will also work.
2010/06/15: The token will not be kicked, even if the creature it's copying was.
2010/06/15: If you activate the ability and the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, you still get a token. The enchanted creature's last existence on the battlefield is checked to see what it was (specifically, if it was itself or if it was copying something else).
2010/06/15: The token is exiled at the beginning of the next end step regardless of who controls it at that time, or whether <Splinter Twin> or the enchanted creature is still on the battlefield at that time.

<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).

2010/06/15: <Surreal Memoir> isn't targeted. You don't choose an instant card at random from your graveyard until it resolves. Once you randomly select a card, it's too late for players to respond.
2010/06/15: If you have only one instant card in your graveyard as <Surreal Memoir> resolves, that's the one you'll return to your hand.
2010/06/15: If you're playing a format involving only cards from the _Urza's Saga_(TM) set and later, you may change the order of your graveyard at any time. That means the easiest way to choose an instant card at random from your graveyard is to take all the instant cards in your graveyard, turn them face down, shuffle them, and pick a card. Then you just put the rest back.
2010/06/15: If you're playing a format involving cards printed earlier than the _Urza's Saga_ set, you may not reorder your graveyard. In this case, you need to be more careful when selecting an instant card at random, perhaps by using dice, writing the names of the instant cards on slips of paper and choosing one of them randomly, or carefully noting the existing graveyard order so you can reestablish it after performing the method suggested above, for example.
2010/06/15: If you have multiple instant cards in your graveyard with the same name, and one of them is being targeted by another spell on the stack or is enchanted (with Spellweaver Volute, for example), you must differentiate them so you know which one (if any) is chosen at random. In that case, it may be better to use dice or another method that allows you to differentiate between the instant cards to choose one at random.
2010/06/15: All players get to see which card you chose at random.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: As long as <World at War> resolves before the first postcombat main phase of a turn ends, it will have its full effect. That will happen in most cases, since it's a sorcery (meaning it's probably cast during the first or second main phase of a turn), and it has rebound (meaning it'll be cast during your upkeep). If, however, it's cast later than that, it won't create any new phases. For example, if one <World at War> creates a second combat phase and a third main phase in a turn, then a second <World at War> is cast during that third main phase, no additional phases are created. The rebound effect still works, though.
2010/06/15: Multiple <World at War> effects are cumulative, as long as they're cast early enough. The first one modifies the turn structure to this: beginning phase, precombat main phase, combat phase, postcombat main phase, [new combat phase], [new postcombat main phase], ending phase. Each subsequent one inserts another combat phase and main phase into the turn after the original postcombat main phase and before the newest combat phase.
2010/06/15: Unlike other similar cards (such as Relentless Assault), <World at War> doesn't untap the creatures that have attacked this turn when it resolves. Rather, those creatures untap when the new combat phase created by the spell begins. All creatures that attacked this turn untap, regardless of which combat phase they attacked in (if there have been more than one) or who controls them (if you're playing a Two-Headed Giant game, for example).
2010/06/15: You don't have to attack with any creatures during the new combat phase.</Rulings>

Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>198304</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2010/06/15: When the enchanted creature attacks, all lands controlled by that creature's controller (who is not necessarily the Aura's controller) untap.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: <Khalni Hydra>'s cost reduction effect doesn't change its mana cost or converted mana cost.
2010/06/15: If an effect (such as the one from Lodestone Golem) imposes an additional generic mana cost to casting <Khalni Hydra>, the Hydra's ability will reduce it too. It'll reduce the amount of green mana you need to spend first, though.</Rulings>

Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193565</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)</CardText>
<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193585</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
2010/06/15: If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead — but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
2010/06/15: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
2010/06/15: Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
2010/06/15: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.
2010/06/15: <Snake Umbra> grants the triggered ability to the creature. It triggers whenever the enchanted creature deals damage to an opponent of its controller (who is not necessarily an opponent of the Aura's controller). In other words, if your <Snake Umbra> winds up enchanting your opponent's creature, that opponent will draw a card whenever that creature damages you.
2010/06/15: The ability triggers when the enchanted creature deals any damage, not just combat damage.
2013/07/01: Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
2013/07/01: If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor has indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
2013/07/01: Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead — but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow gains indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>193451</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent (as the annihilator ability does), you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent (as Prowling Pangolin's ability does), you can't take that option.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to perform an action unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Ogre Marauder does), you can't choose to sacrifice a permanent. You must perform the action. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Rishadan Brigand does), you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since you can't sacrifice any permanents.
2010/06/15: You may still sacrifice permanents to pay the costs of spells you cast and abilities you activate, or because a resolving spell or ability you control instructs or allows you to do so. Notably, you may still sacrifice Eldrazi Spawn creature tokens for mana.
2010/06/15: You may sacrifice a permanent to pay the activation cost of an ability, even if that ability comes from a permanent an opponent controls (such as Excavation).
2010/06/15: You may sacrifice a permanent as a special action, even if the effect that allows you to do so comes from an opponent's permanent (such as Damping Engine or Volrath's Curse). No one controls special actions.
2010/06/15: This ability affects only sacrifices. It won't stop a creature from being put into the graveyard due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into the graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.</Rulings>

<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Multiverseid>193556</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If you cast your second creature spell in a turn and <Vengevine> is in your graveyard, <Vengevine>'s second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it. The ability will resolve, allowing you to return <Vengevine> to the battlefield, before the creature spell does.
2010/06/15: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability works only if <Vengevine> is already in your graveyard as you finish casting your second creature spell in a turn, and it remains there continuously until the ability resolves.
2010/06/15: <Vengevine> doesn't need to be in your graveyard as you start casting your second creature spell in a turn, only as you finish. This matters if you sacrifice a <Vengevine> on the battlefield while casting that creature spell, perhaps to pay a cost of that spell or a cost of a mana ability.
2010/06/15: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability checks the card types of the spells you cast over the course of the entire turn, not just the ones you cast while <Vengevine> is in your graveyard. For example, if you cast a creature spell, then <Vengevine> is put into your graveyard, then you cast another creature spell, <Vengevine>'s ability triggers.
2010/06/15: <Vengevine>'s ability triggers only for the second creature spell you cast in a turn. It won't trigger for the third, fourth, or so on. It also doesn't matter how many noncreature spells you cast in a turn; the ability counts just the creature spells.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: Unlike previous planeswalkers, <Sarkhan the Mad> has no way to raise his loyalty.

2010/06/15: The first ability causes Sarkhan to deal damage directly to himself, resulting in that many loyalty counters being removed from him. The damage would never have been dealt to you, so prevention effects that would prevent damage from being dealt to you won't affect it.
2010/06/15: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time the second ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve. The player won't get a Dragon token.
2010/06/15: If the targeted creature is a legal target by the time the second ability resolves but its controller can't sacrifice it (due to Tajuru Preserver, perhaps), the ability continues to resolve. That player gets a Dragon token.
2010/06/15: You choose a single target as you activate the third ability. All your Dragons deal damage to that player.

<Rulings>2010/06/15: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell, <Sphinx-Bone Wand>'s ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it. The ability will resolve before the spell does.
2010/06/15: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve. You won't put a charge counter on <Sphinx-Bone Wand> and it won't deal damage.
2010/06/15: If <Sphinx-Bone Wand> leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, you won't be able to put a charge counter on it. As a result, it won't deal damage.</Rulings>
