<CardText>The owner of target permanent shuffles it into their library, then reveals the top card of their library. If it's a permanent card, they put it onto the battlefield.</CardText>
<Artist>Trevor Claxton</Artist>
<Multiverseid>338441</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: The owner of a token is the player under whose control the token was put onto the battlefield. If a token is shuffled into a player's library this way, that player shuffles before revealing the top card of that library.
2011/09/22: If the permanent is an illegal target by the time <Chaos Warp> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will occur. No library will be shuffled and no card will be revealed.
2011/09/22: A permanent card is a card with one or more of the following card types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker.
2011/09/22: If the revealed card is a permanent card but can't enter the battlefield (perhaps because it's an Aura with nothing to enchant), it remains on top of that library.
2011/09/22: If the revealed card is not a permanent card, it remains on top of that library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or an effect changes your commander's color.
2011/09/22: If your commander is a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth that has no colors in its color identity, <Command Tower>'s ability produces no mana.

<Artist>Mathias Kollros</Artist>
<Multiverseid>338453</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

2016/06/08: <Duplicant>'s base power and toughness change to the imprinted card's power and toughness. Counters and other effects that modify <Duplicant>'s power and toughness still apply.
2016/06/08: Abilities that define a creature's power and toughness apply while that card is in exile, but abilities that add or subtract from it don't. For example, the ability of Battle Squadron applies to determine <Duplicant>'s power and toughness, but the ability of Werebear doesn't. <Duplicant>'s power and toughness are constantly updated if the exiled card's power and/or toughness change.
2016/06/08: <Duplicant> keeps all creature types it had when the card was imprinted, including any types that <Duplicant> had gained.
