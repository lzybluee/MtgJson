<CardText>{3}: Urza deals 1 damage to any target.</CardText>
<Flavor>An artificer of unparalleled renown, Urza was a powerful cipher even before he was able to planeswalk.

<CardText>If a creature you control would deal damage, it deals double that damage instead.</CardText>
<Flavor>Both complement and antithesis to his older brother Urza, Mishra also mastered the intricacies of artifice.

<CardText>Whenever a creature deals damage to you, destroy it.</CardText>
<Flavor>Ashnod served as Mishra's confidante while he led Fallaji weapons development before the Brothers' War. Whereas Mishra works in metals and stone, however, Ashnod works in living flesh.
