<CardText>Enchant player
Whenever enchanted player casts an instant or sorcery spell, each other player may copy that spell and may choose new targets for the copy they control.</CardText>
<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Multiverseid>262841</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/22: When the triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of that spell for each other player. The active player creates their copy and may choose new targets first (if that player isn't the enchanted player), then each other player (except the enchanted player) creates their copy and may choose new targets in turn order. The last player who creates their copy controls the copy that will resolve first.
2011/01/22: All the copies are created on the stack, so none of them are cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copies will then resolve as normal, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2011/01/22: Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless its controller chooses new ones. That player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, that player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2011/01/22: If the original spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), each copy will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
2011/01/22: If the original spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, each copy has the same value of X.
2011/01/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if the enchanted player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, each copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>Michael C. Hayes</Artist>
<Multiverseid>227091</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/22: <Curse of Bloodletting> works with any damage, not just combat damage. It also doesn't matter who controls the source of the damage that's being dealt.
2011/01/22: The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, often the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will also specify the source of the damage, although the ability itself will never be that source. Often the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
2011/01/22: If more than one <Curse of Bloodletting> enchants the same player, damage dealt to that player will double for each one (two of them will end up multiplying the damage by four, three of them by eight, and four of them by sixteen).
2011/01/22: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt to the enchanted player, that player chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Suppose a spell would deal 5 damage to enchanted player and that player has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The enchanted player can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let <Curse of Bloodletting>'s effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.</Rulings>

If it's no longer on the battlefield when the ability resolves, its last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its power.
2011/01/22: <Flayer of the Hatebound> is the source of the ability, but it may be another creature that is the source of the damage. If a black creature enters the battlefield from your graveyard, the ability could target a creature with protection from black, although the damage will be prevented. It couldn't target a creature with protection from red.
2011/01/22: Since damage is dealt by the creature, abilities like lifelink and deathtouch are taken into account, even if the creature has left the battlefield by the time it deals damage.

<Artist>Anthony Francisco</Artist>
<Multiverseid>262661</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/22: <Increasing Vengeance> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2011/01/22: When <Increasing Vengeance> resolves, it creates one or two copies of a spell. You control each of the copies. Those copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copies will then resolve like normal spells, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2011/01/22: Each of the copies will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). If there are two copies, you may change the targets of each of them to different legal targets.
2011/01/22: If the spell <Increasing Vengeance> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
2011/01/22: If the spell <Increasing Vengeance> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2011/01/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copies too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling and then copy it with <Increasing Vengeance>, the copies of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/22: <Havengul Lich>'s activated ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when you cast the creature card. This triggered ability will go on the stack on top of the creature spell and will resolve before the creature spell will.
2011/01/22: If you don't cast the creature card that turn, <Havengul Lich> won't gain any of its abilities.
2011/01/22: <Havengul Lich> gains the activated abilities of the card while that card is still a spell on the stack.
2013/04/15: <Havengul Lich>'s ability changes the zone you are permitted to cast the card from, not the times you are permitted to cast it. You can cast a creature card that has been targeted by <Havengul Lich> from the graveyard, but unless it has flash, you can only do so if it's your main phase, the stack is empty, and you have priority.
2016/06/08: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.</Rulings>

2011/01/22: Elbrus will transform even if you are unable to unattach it (most likely because the equipped creature died).
2011/01/22: Withengar's triggered ability will trigger no matter how a player loses the game: due to a state-based action (as a result of having a life total of 0 or less, trying to draw a card from an empty library, or having ten poison counters), a spell or ability that says that player loses the game, a concession, or a game loss awarded by a judge.
2011/01/22: In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (such as a Grand Melee game), if a spell or ability says that you win the game, it instead causes all of your opponents within your range of influence to lose the game. This is another way by which Withengar's ability can trigger.
