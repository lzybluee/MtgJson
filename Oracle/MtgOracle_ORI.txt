<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Multiverseid>398611</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: Hixus's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like Hixus have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield.
2015/06/22: If Hixus leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the creature that dealt combat damage to you won't be exiled.
2015/06/22: Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
2015/06/22: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/06/22: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/06/22: In a multiplayer game, if Hixus's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: Gideon's first ability causes a creature to attack him if able. If, during its controller's declare attackers step, that creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under its controller's control continuously since that player's turn began, then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If they don't, the creature doesn't have to attack.
2015/06/22: If the creature targeted by Gideon's first ability changes controllers before it has the chance to attack Gideon, the ability will apply to it during its new controller's next turn.
2015/06/22: If Gideon can't be attacked, perhaps because he has left the battlefield before the creature's controller's next combat, the creature targeted by Gideon's first ability can attack you or another planeswalker you control, or its controller can choose to have it not attack at all.
2015/06/22: If Gideon becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2015/06/22: Gideon's third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2015/06/22: If you activate Gideon's third ability and then damage is dealt to him that can't be prevented, that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action. (As long as he still has indestructible, the marked damage won't cause him to be destroyed.)
2015/06/22: Kytheon's first ability will count creatures that attacked but are no longer on the battlefield (perhaps because they didn't survive combat damage being dealt). It will not count any creatures that were put onto the battlefield attacking, as those creatures were never declared as attackers.
2015/06/22: Say you activate Gideon's third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon (since he's still a planeswalker). Then Gideon may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him. During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).
2017/09/29: You can control two of this permanent, one front-face up and the other back-face up, at the same time.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: Gideon's first ability causes a creature to attack him if able. If, during its controller's declare attackers step, that creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under its controller's control continuously since that player's turn began, then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If they don't, the creature doesn't have to attack.
2015/06/22: If the creature targeted by Gideon's first ability changes controllers before it has the chance to attack Gideon, the ability will apply to it during its new controller's next turn.
2015/06/22: If Gideon can't be attacked, perhaps because he has left the battlefield before the creature's controller's next combat, the creature targeted by Gideon's first ability can attack you or another planeswalker you control, or its controller can choose to have it not attack at all.
2015/06/22: If Gideon becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2015/06/22: Gideon's third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2015/06/22: If you activate Gideon's third ability and then damage is dealt to him that can't be prevented, that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action. (As long as he still has indestructible, the marked damage won't cause him to be destroyed.)
2015/06/22: Kytheon's first ability will count creatures that attacked but are no longer on the battlefield (perhaps because they didn't survive combat damage being dealt). It will not count any creatures that were put onto the battlefield attacking, as those creatures were never declared as attackers.
2015/06/22: Say you activate Gideon's third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon (since he's still a planeswalker). Then Gideon may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him. During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).
2017/09/29: You can control two of this permanent, one front-face up and the other back-face up, at the same time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jonas De Ro</Artist>
<Multiverseid>398652</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: Ending the turn this way means the following things happen in order: 1) All spells and abilities on the stack are exiled. This includes spells and abilities that can't be countered. 2) If there are any attacking and blocking creatures, they're removed from combat. 3) State-based actions are checked. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. 5) The cleanup step happens in its entirety.
2015/06/22: If any triggered abilities do trigger during the process of ending the turn, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn ends.
2015/06/22: Though other spells and abilities that are exiled won't get a chance to resolve, they don't count as being countered.
2015/06/22: Any "at the beginning of the next end step" triggered abilities won't get the chance to trigger that turn because the end step is skipped. Those abilities will trigger at the beginning of the end step of the next turn. The same is true of abilities that trigger at the beginning of other phases or steps.
2015/06/22: If both your hand and graveyard are empty as <Day's Undoing> starts resolving, you'll still shuffle your library before drawing seven cards.
2017/04/18: If any abilities trigger while players are shuffling cards into their library or drawing seven cards, those abilities cease to exist when the turn ends. They won't be put on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: If you activate the second ability of Jace, Telepath Unbound, you must follow the timing rules for the card's types. For example, if you target a sorcery card, you may cast it during your main phase when the stack is empty. You pay all the spell's costs.
2015/06/22: If you don't cast the card that turn, nothing happens. It remains in your graveyard.
2015/06/22: The card is exiled only if it's cast from the graveyard and put back into the graveyard (either by resolving or being countered). If, at any time, the card goes to a hidden zone (such as your hand or your library), the effect loses track of the card. It won't be exiled, even if that card is put into your graveyard later that turn.
2015/06/22: The activated ability of <Jace, Vryn's Prodigy> checks to see if there are five or more cards in your graveyard after you discard a card. Putting a fifth card into your graveyard at other times won't cause Jace to be exiled, nor will Jace entering the battlefield while there are five or more cards in your graveyard.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving the ability of <Jace, Vryn's Prodigy>, you'll need to already have five other cards in your graveyard to satisfy that ability's condition. You can't choose to put the card directly into your graveyard to satisfy it.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).

<Rulings>2015/06/22: If changing one target of a spell or ability to <Mizzium Meddler> would make other targets of that spell or ability illegal, the targets remain unchanged.
2015/06/22: If the spell or ability has multiple instances of the word "target," you choose which target you're changing to <Mizzium Meddler> as Mizium Meddler's ability resolves.
2015/06/22: The target of the spell or ability won't change unless <Mizzium Meddler> fulfills all the targeting criteria. If a spell or ability has multiple targets, such as Send to Sleep, you can change only one of the targets to <Mizzium Meddler>.
2015/06/22: If a spell or ability has a variable number of targets, you can't change the number of targets.

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>398479</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: The target instant or sorcery spell can have other targets as long as one of them is you.
2015/06/22: If the spell mastery ability applies, you'll create a copy of the instant or sorcery spell only if <Psychic Rebuttal> counters that spell. If that spell can't be countered by spells or abilities, you won't get a copy.
2015/06/22: If <Psychic Rebuttal> creates a copy of the spell, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2015/06/22: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2015/06/22: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one –" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2015/06/22: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2015/06/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2015/06/22: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.
2015/06/22: Check to see if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard as the spell resolves to determine whether the spell mastery ability applies. The spell itself won't count because it's still on the stack as you make this check.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: You draw a card as <Dark Dabbling> resolves, not as the creature actually regenerates.
2015/06/22: Check to see if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard as the spell resolves to determine whether the spell mastery ability applies. The spell itself won't count because it's still on the stack as you make this check.
2018/12/07: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time <Dark Dabbling> tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card and no creatures are regenerated.
2018/12/07: <Dark Dabbling> is still on the stack while you count the number of instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard. It doesn't count itself.
2018/12/07: <Dark Dabbling>'s spell mastery ability is a normal spell effect, not a replacement effect. This means that if you replace drawing a card for <Dark Dabbling>'s effect with dredging a card from your graveyard, the cards put into your graveyard this way may enable the additional regeneration.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: You choose the mode as the triggered ability goes on the stack. You can choose a mode that requires targets only if there are legal targets available.
2015/06/22: If the ability doesn't resolve (either for having its target become illegal or because a spell or ability counters it), the mode chosen for that instance of the ability still counts as being chosen.
2015/06/22: The phrase "that hasn't been chosen" refers only to that specific <Demonic Pact>. If you control one and cast another one, you can choose any mode for the second one the first time its ability triggers.
2015/06/22: It doesn't matter who has chosen any particular mode. For example, say you control <Demonic Pact> and have chosen the first two modes. If an opponent gains control of <Demonic Pact>, that player can choose only the third or fourth mode.
2015/06/22: In some very unusual situations, you may not be able to choose a mode, either because all modes have previously been chosen or the only remaining modes require targets and there are no legal targets available. In this case, the ability is simply removed from the stack with no effect.
2015/06/22: Yes, if the fourth mode is the only one remaining, you must choose it. You read the whole contract, right?</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>398441</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: If multiple nontoken creatures you control die, then <Liliana, Heretical Healer>'s ability will trigger that many times. However, since Liliana can be exiled and returned to the battlefield only once, only the first ability to resolve will create a Zombie token. The other abilities will resolve but won't do anything.
2015/06/22: When Liliana, Defiant Necromancer's first ability resolves, first you choose a card to discard, then each other player in turn order chooses a card to discard, then all those cards are discarded simultaneously. No one sees what the other players are discarding before deciding which card to discard.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).

<Rulings>2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: The emblem created by Chandra, Roaring Flame is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.
2015/06/22: Only players actually dealt damage by the third ability of Chandra, Roaring Flame will get an emblem. If all of that damage to a player is prevented, that player won't get an emblem. If any of that damage is redirected to Chandra's controller, that player will get an emblem.
2015/06/22: <Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh>'s activated ability will count any damage Chandra has dealt during the turn to any permanent or player, including combat damage.
2015/06/22: Each player who gets Chandra's emblem is the owner of that emblem. In multiplayer games, that emblem will remain in the game as long as its owner does, even if Chandra's owner leaves the game.
2015/06/22: The last sentence of <Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh>'s activated ability isn't a separate ability. The check happens only as that activated ability resolves. You must activate the ability in order to exile Chandra and return her to the battlefield transformed, even if Chandra has already dealt 3 or more damage during the turn.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).

<Rulings>2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: The emblem created by <Chandra, Roaring Flame> is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.
2015/06/22: Only players actually dealt damage by the third ability of <Chandra, Roaring Flame> will get an emblem. If all of that damage to a player is prevented, that player won't get an emblem. If any of that damage is redirected to Chandra's controller, that player will get an emblem.
2015/06/22: Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh's activated ability will count any damage Chandra has dealt during the turn to any permanent or player, including combat damage.
2015/06/22: Each player who gets Chandra's emblem is the owner of that emblem. In multiplayer games, that emblem will remain in the game as long as its owner does, even if Chandra's owner leaves the game.
2015/06/22: The last sentence of Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh's activated ability isn't a separate ability. The check happens only as that activated ability resolves.

<Rulings>2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2015/06/22: You can activate Nissa, Sage Animist's second ability even if you already control an Ashaya, the Awoken World. Just after the second token is created, you'll choose one to remain on the battlefield. The other will be put into your graveyard and subsequently cease to exist.
2015/06/22: <Nissa, Vastwood Seer> is exiled as a result of her second triggered ability. If she enters the battlefield while you control seven or more lands, she won't automatically be exiled and transform.
2015/06/22: If a land becomes a creature but hasn't continuously been under its controller's control since that player's most recent turn began, it won't be able to attack and its abilities with {T} in the cost (including mana abilities) won't be able to be activated. In other words, look at how long the permanent itself has been under your control, not how long it's been a creature.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).
2017/09/29: You can control two of this permanent, one front-face up and the other back-face up, at the same time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Richard Wright</Artist>
<Multiverseid>398564</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: If an effect would set your life total to a specific number that's higher than your current life total, that effect would cause you to gain life equal to the difference. <Alhammarret's Archive> will then double the amount of life that effect would cause you to gain. For example, if you have 3 life and an effect says that your life total "becomes 10," your life total will actually become 17.
2015/06/22: If two or more replacement effects would apply to a card-drawing event, the player drawing the card chooses the order in which to apply them.
2015/06/22: Because <Alhammarret's Archive> is legendary, it's unlikely that one player will control two. However, if that happens, life gained by that player will be multiplied by four. Three Archives will multiply that life gain by eight, and so on.
2015/06/22: Similarly, the effects of the last abilities of multiple Archives are cumulative. If you control two, you'll draw four times the number of cards, and so on.
2015/06/22: In a Two-Headed Giant game, only the controller of <Alhammarret's Archive> is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, <Alhammarret's Archive> will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the team's shared life total.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: Effects setting <Angel's Tomb>'s base power and toughness to specific values that begin to apply after <Angel's Tomb> has become a creature will override the effect of <Angel's Tomb>.

2015/06/22: If enough -1/-1 counters are put on <Hangarback Walker> at the same time to make its toughness 0 or less, the number of +1/+1 counters on it before it got any -1/-1 counters will be used to determine how many Thopter tokens you get. For example, if there are three +1/+1 counters on <Hangarback Walker> and it gets four -1/-1 counters, you'll get three Thopter tokens. That's because <Hangarback Walker>'s triggered ability checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: The mana produced by <Pyromancer's Goggles> can be spent on anything, not just a red instant or sorcery spell.
2015/06/22: Any red instant or sorcery spell you spend the mana on will be copied, not just one that requires targets.
2015/06/22: The delayed triggered ability will trigger whether <Pyromancer's Goggles> is still on the battlefield or not.
2015/06/22: If more than one red mana produced by a <Pyromancer's Goggles> is spent to cast a single red instant or sorcery spell, the delayed triggered ability associated with each mana spent will trigger. That many copies will be created. It doesn't matter if this red mana was produced by one <Pyromancer's Goggles> or by multiple <Pyromancer's Goggles>.
2015/06/22: If a copy is created, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2015/06/22: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2015/06/22: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one –" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2015/06/22: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2015/06/22: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2015/06/22: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2009/10/01: A "blocking creature" is one that has been declared as a blocker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield blocking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be a blocking creature through the end of combat step, even if the creature or creatures it was blocking are no longer on the battlefield or have otherwise left combat.
2012/07/01: Destroying a blocking creature won't cause any of the creatures it was blocking to become unblocked. They won't deal combat damage to the defending player or planeswalker (unless they have trample).</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>401466</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Prized Unicorn> doesn't give a creature the ability to block it. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block it to do so. For example, it can't force a creature that's tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block to block it. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so the creature doesn't have to block <Prized Unicorn> in that case either.
2009/10/01: If a creature the defending player controls can't block <Prized Unicorn>, it can block any attacking creature, or not block at all.
2009/10/01: If two <Prized Unicorn>s are attacking, each creature the defending player controls can block either one of them. (The defending player chooses.) A creature that can block multiple creatures, like Palace Guard, must block both of them.</Rulings>
