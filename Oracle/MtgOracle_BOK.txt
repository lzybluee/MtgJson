<Rulings>2004/10/04: Use the name of the card as it leaves the battlefield.
2004/10/04: If a copy card is targeted by this effect, you get to look for another copy of the card it is copying. This is because a copy card actually takes on the name and initial characteristics of what it copies.
2004/10/04: Does not exile other cards of the same name that are on the battlefield. Just from the graveyard, hand, and library.
2005/02/01: If you manage to turn a land (such as a Forest or Stalking Stones) into a creature, you can indeed use this effect on that basic land type. <Eradicate>'s exile effect only looks for cards by name, not type.
2005/02/01: The copies must be found if they are in publicly viewable zones. Finding copies while searching private zones is optional.
2012/05/01: A face-down creature has no name, so no card can possibly share a name with it (not even other cards with no name). If you <Eradicate> a face-down creature you will still search its controller's library, but you won't be able to exile any cards from that library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2005/02/01: You must still pay the mana cost of the target instant in your graveyard to cast it using Toshiro's ability.
2011/01/01: Creatures destroyed by an instant that you cast normally can cause a trigger that allows the instant to be cast again. For example, cast Terror on an opponent's creature. The creature is destroyed, triggering Toshiro's ability, and then the Terror is put into your graveyard. You can put Toshiro's ability on the stack targeting the Terror and then recast it when the ability resolves.</Rulings>

Choosing the "Equipped creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn" mode does nothing if the Jitte isn't equipped to a creature when the ability resolves.
2005/02/01: If the Jitte is moved after the "+2/+2" mode is announced but before it resolves, the bonus is given to the creature that is equipped when the ability resolves.
