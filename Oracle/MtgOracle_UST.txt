2018/01/19: You can control multiple permanents with the supertype world. So, that opens up some deck ideas, I'd imagine. (704.5k)
2018/01/19: Auras you control stay on the battlefield if they're attached to an illegal permanent or if they aren't attached to a permanent (but should be). They may not do much because there probably won't be an "enchanted [whatever]," but they'll stay on the battlefield! (704.5m) Similarly, thanks to an un-documented silver-bordered state-based action no longer applying, your creatures with augment can now survive even if not attached to a host. If this happens, its power and toughness are 0/0. (704.5m)
2018/01/19: Equipment and Fortifications you control can stay attached to an illegal permanent. (704.5n)
2018/01/19: If you somehow control a creature that's attached to another permanent, that creature can stay attached. It can attack and block, even if another creature is carrying it. Similarly, if you control a permanent that isn't an Aura, an Equipment, or a Fortification, it can stay attached to whatever you manage to get it attached to. Strange. (704.5p)
2018/01/19: +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters on permanents you control no longer annihilate each other. (704.5q)
2018/01/19: Good news for Rasputin Dreamweaver fans: you can ignore abilities of permanents you control that say it can't have more than a certain number of a certain kind of counter. (704.5r)
2018/01/19: Your Two-Headed Giant team can no longer lose because you have 0 or less life or fifteen or more poison counters. (704.5s and 704.5t)
2018/01/19: In Commander, you're immune to the "commander damage rule" that says you lose if a single commander deals 21 or more combat damage to you. (704.5u)
2018/01/19: Because <Rules Lawyer> applies only to you and other permanents you control, tokens that leave the battlefield will continue to cease to exist. This is also true for copies of cards that might exist off the battlefield.
2018/01/19: Any ability that says a player wins or loses the game still works.
2018/01/19: <Rules Lawyer>'s ability doesn't apply to itself. It can die for any number of reasons. If you're at 0 or less life and you lose control of <Rules Lawyer>, you'll immediately lose the game.
2018/01/19: A creature with toughness 0 or less can still attack and block. It blocks an attacking creature with trample, treat its toughness as 0 when determining how to assign combat damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: To steal a phase means that during that player's next turn, as the chosen phase begins, you treat it as if it were your turn. Here's what happens if you steal each phase:
2018/01/19: Beginning phase: You untap permanents you control and your opponent doesn't. Abilities that trigger at the beginning of your upkeep happen and ones that trigger at the beginning of their upkeep don't. You draw a card as it's now your draw step, so your opponent doesn't.
2018/01/19: Precombat main phase: You can cast all types of spells while your opponent can only cast instants and spells with flash.
2018/01/19: Combat phase: Just like combat on your turn, you can attack your opponents with your creatures. The opponent you stole the phase from can't attack with their creatures, but they can block.
2018/01/19: Postcombat main phase: Same as precombat main phase.
2018/01/19: Ending phase: Most abilities that trigger during the end step don't care whose turn it is, but a few do. Effects that last "until end of turn" or "this turn" will expire as normal, as they also don't care whose turn it is.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If an effect asks how many cards are in your graveyard, use the total number of cards in all your graveyards. However, they are still separate graveyards. If an effect affects a single graveyard, such as shuffling it into its owner's library, only that one graveyard is shuffled in.
2018/01/19: Speaking of that, cards in graveyards are shuffled into their owners' libraries. You won't put any cards from graveyards you stole, er . . . borrowed into your library.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: The first ability lets you roll a six-sided die and put that result on <Socketed Sprocketer>. This basically saves that result for later use. Say you roll a 5. Put the die on <Socketed Sprocketer> with the 5 face up. Later in the game, when you roll another die, you can choose to use the 5 instead of the result. (You'll see the result before having to decide.) If you have a 6 installed on Socketed Sprocket, you can just uninstall it to draw a card. If you do this, the 6 is gone and can't be used to replace a future die roll.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: To turn over a creature means to physically turn the card over. If the result is a face-down card, it's a colorless 2/2 creature, the same as one would get from using the morph ability. Turning a face-down card over results in it being turned face up. Any abilities that trigger when it's turned face up will work. Turning a double-faced card over is the same as transforming it. Any abilities that trigger when you transform it will work. Turning a combined host/augment creature over will result in a big colorless 2/2 creature represented by two cards. Turning a melded creature over will result in the two cards breaking apart and forming two separate creatures, but they'll probably just get right back together. Turning B.F.M. (Big Furry Monster) over is the same as turning a combined creature over.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: During combat, creature cards in graveyards can attack and block just as if they were on the battlefield. Attacking creature cards in the graveyard can be blocked only by creature cards in the defending player's graveyard.
2018/01/19: Creature cards in graveyards can attack planeswalkers on the battlefield.
2018/01/19: Other combat-relevant abilities such as flying work on attacking or blocking creature cards in graveyards. An attacking creature card with flying in a graveyard could be blocked only by creature cards with flying or reach in graveyards.
2018/01/19: <Over My Dead Bodies> allows you to attack or block with creature cards in your graveyard. If you do, for the duration of combat, the attacking and blocking creature cards are treated as if they are creature cards on the battlefield which means they can be affected by spells or abilities that would affect creatures on the battlefield. That means, for example, if you have a Lord of Accursed on the battlefield ("Other Zombies you control get +1/+1"), all your attacking and blocking graveyard creatures (which <Over My Dead Bodies> makes into Zombies) would get +1/+1 while in combat.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: If you use the second ability to roll two dice instead of one, any ability that triggers "whenever you roll a die" will trigger twice.
2018/01/19: If another spell or ability instructs you to roll two dice and use the difference, you can use <The Big Idea>'s second ability to replace one of those die rolls. First, roll two dice and use their sum. That's the first result. Then roll one die. That's the second result. Then figure out the difference between those two results.
2018/01/19: Some cards, like Chittering Doom, care about the results of individual die rolls and not the total if two dice are rolled together. For example, if you use <The Big Idea>'s second ability to replace one die roll with two and roll two 3s, Chittering Doom's ability (which triggers whenever you roll 4 or higher on a die) won't trigger.</Rulings>

If you give a creature double strike to a creature with last strike, it'll deal combat damage three times: once during first-strike combat damage, again during normal combat damage, and again during last-strike damage. Essentially, double strike + last strike = triple strike.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>439473</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

All combat damage is dealt simultaneously, unless a strike ability (first, double, last, and/or triple) is involved.
2018/01/19: If <Party Crasher> attacks during an opponent's turn, that opponent could block it with an attacking creature that is untapped as blockers are declared. That creature will then be attacking and blocking at the same time. If <Party Crasher> is also untapped as blockers are declared, it can block the attacking creature that blocked it.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Creatures with augment don't have a mana cost and can't be cast.
2018/01/19: Augment is an activated ability that you activate from your hand. To do so, reveal the card, choose a target host creature, and pay the augment cost. As this ability resolves, if the card with augment is still in your hand, put it onto the battlefield combined with the host creature.
2018/01/19: Augment can (and usually does) change the name, card types, subtypes, rules text, and power/toughness. The combined creature will have (at least) two artists and may now have multiple colors. Anything covered up in the augment process doesn't count, so ignore things to the left of the "metal bar" in the art of host creatures.
2018/01/19: Augment can't target creatures that aren't host creatures.
2018/01/19: The creature card with augment isn't put onto the battlefield until the ability resolves. This means if the host is destroyed, the creature with augment stays in your hand. You can't choose a different host, but you can activate augment again if there's another host available.
2018/01/19: You can't activate augment unless there is a host creature on the battlefield. It doesn't need to be yours. Note though that if you augment another player's host creature, they control the combined creature.
2018/01/19: You can't put more than one augment card on a single host creature. Once a host creature is augmented, the host part gets covered up and it's no longer a host creature.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If Phoebe has abilities that contradict one another, the most recently added one wins. For example, if Phoebe has the text boxes of both Beast of Burden (power and toughness equal to the number of creatures on the battlefield) and Psychosis Crawler (power and toughness equal to the number of cards in your hand). Phoebe's power and toughness would be defined by the text box added most recently.

However, the effects are all good for you or bad for your opponent. In some cases, you may not be able to take advantage. For example, if it ends up that creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn but you don't control any creatures, you're out of luck. But nothing bad will happen.

2018/01/19: Each keyword can be chosen only once on any given day. And that counts every <Modular Monstrosity> you play with that day. You also can't reuse a keyword with a new modifier. For example, if you choose protection from Demons and from Dragons (totally counts), you can't choose protection from red later that day. Protection has already been used.

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Contraptions are artifacts. Anything that interacts with artifacts will interact with Contraptions.
2018/01/19: Contraptions aren't put into your main deck. They go into a separate deck called the Contraption deck.
2018/01/19: In Constructed formats, a Contraption deck must have at least fifteen different Contraption cards and no more than one of each.
2018/01/19: In Limited formats, a Contraption deck may include any number of Contraption cards in your card pool. You don't have to include every Contraption card you draft or open in sealed deck. In those formats, your Contraption deck may include duplicates.
2018/01/19: In silver-bordered games using Contraptions, you have three sprockets, illustrated on the back of Contraption cards. At the start of the game, put a CRANK! counter on sprocket 3.
2018/01/19: While Contraptions you control are on the battlefield, the Contraption deck is not, even if you are using it to signify the three sprockets.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control are instructed to assemble a Contraption, reveal the top card of your Contraption deck. Put it onto the battlefield on one of the three sprockets.
2018/01/19: At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control any Contraptions, move the CRANK! counter to the next sprocket. You may then crank any number of Contraptions on that sprocket, causing their abilities to trigger. Cranking a Contraption is always optional.
2018/01/19: If you crank multiple Contraptions, their abilities can be put onto the stack in any order. The ability put onto the stack will resolve first.
2018/01/19: If a Contraption would leave the battlefield and go to any zone other than exile, it instead goes to the scrapyard, the Contraption deck's version of the graveyard. Things that affect the graveyard do not affect the scrapyard. You can exile Contraptions just fine.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control assembles a Contraption and your Contraption deck is empty, nothing happens. You don't lose the game.
2018/01/19: Any Contraption that's on the battlefield and wasn't assembled immediately heads to the scrapyard. However, if it's a not an actual Contraption card (like Copy Artifact isn't), it goes to your graveyard as normal. Non-Contraption cards can't be in the scrapyard.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If you crank multiple Contraptions, their abilities can be put onto the stack in any order. The ability put onto the stack will resolve first.
2018/01/19: If a Contraption would leave the battlefield and go to any zone other than exile, it instead goes to the scrapyard, the Contraption deck's version of the graveyard. Things that affect the graveyard do not affect the scrapyard. You can exile Contraptions just fine.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control assembles a Contraption and your Contraption deck is empty, nothing happens. You don't lose the game.
2018/01/19: Any Contraption that's on the battlefield and wasn't assembled immediately heads to the scrapyard. However, if it's a not an actual Contraption card (like Copy Artifact isn't), it goes to your graveyard as normal. Non-Contraption cards can't be in the scrapyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Contraptions are artifacts. Anything that interacts with artifacts will interact with Contraptions.
2018/01/19: Contraptions aren't put into your main deck. They go into a separate deck called the Contraption deck.
2018/01/19: In Constructed formats, a Contraption deck must have at least fifteen different Contraption cards and no more than one of each.
2018/01/19: In Limited formats, a Contraption deck may include any number of Contraption cards in your card pool. You don't have to include every Contraption card you draft or open in sealed deck. In those formats, your Contraption deck may include duplicates.
2018/01/19: In silver-bordered games using Contraptions, you have three sprockets, illustrated on the back of Contraption cards. At the start of the game, put a CRANK! counter on sprocket 3.
2018/01/19: While Contraptions you control are on the battlefield, the Contraption deck is not, even if you are using it to signify the three sprockets.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control are instructed to assemble a Contraption, reveal the top card of your Contraption deck. Put it onto the battlefield on one of the three sprockets.
2018/01/19: At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control any Contraptions, move the CRANK! counter to the next sprocket. You may then crank any number of Contraptions on that sprocket, causing their abilities to trigger. Cranking a Contraption is always optional.
2018/01/19: If you crank multiple Contraptions, their abilities can be put onto the stack in any order. The ability put onto the stack will resolve first.
2018/01/19: If a Contraption would leave the battlefield and go to any zone other than exile, it instead goes to the scrapyard, the Contraption deck's version of the graveyard. Things that affect the graveyard do not affect the scrapyard. You can exile Contraptions just fine.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control assembles a Contraption and your Contraption deck is empty, nothing happens. You don't lose the game.
2018/01/19: Any Contraption that's on the battlefield and wasn't assembled immediately heads to the scrapyard. However, if it's a not an actual Contraption card (like Copy Artifact isn't), it goes to your graveyard as normal. Non-Contraption cards can't be in the scrapyard.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: In silver-bordered games using Contraptions, you have three sprockets, illustrated on the back of Contraption cards. At the start of the game, put a CRANK! counter on sprocket 3.

2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control are instructed to assemble a Contraption, reveal the top card of your Contraption deck. Put it onto the battlefield on one of the three sprockets.
2018/01/19: At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control any Contraptions, move the CRANK! counter to the next sprocket. You may then crank any number of Contraptions on that sprocket, causing their abilities to trigger. Cranking a Contraption is always optional.
2018/01/19: If you crank multiple Contraptions, their abilities can be put onto the stack in any order. The ability put onto the stack will resolve first.
2018/01/19: If a Contraption would leave the battlefield and go to any zone other than exile, it instead goes to the scrapyard, the Contraption deck's version of the graveyard. Things that affect the graveyard do not affect the scrapyard. You can exile Contraptions just fine.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control assembles a Contraption and your Contraption deck is empty, nothing happens. You don't lose the game.
2018/01/19: Any Contraption that's on the battlefield and wasn't assembled immediately heads to the scrapyard. However, if it's a not an actual Contraption card (like Copy Artifact isn't), it goes to your graveyard as normal. Non-Contraption cards can't be in the scrapyard.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If you crank multiple Contraptions, their abilities can be put onto the stack in any order. The ability put onto the stack will resolve first.
2018/01/19: If a Contraption would leave the battlefield and go to any zone other than exile, it instead goes to the scrapyard, the Contraption deck's version of the graveyard. Things that affect the graveyard do not affect the scrapyard. You can exile Contraptions just fine.
2018/01/19: If you or a permanent you control assembles a Contraption and your Contraption deck is empty, nothing happens. You don't lose the game.
2018/01/19: Any Contraption that's on the battlefield and wasn't assembled immediately heads to the scrapyard. However, if it's a not an actual Contraption card (like Copy Artifact isn't), it goes to your graveyard as normal. Non-Contraption cards can't be in the scrapyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Contraptions are artifacts. Anything that interacts with artifacts will interact with Contraptions.
2018/01/19: Contraptions aren't put into your main deck. They go into a separate deck called the Contraption deck.
2018/01/19: In Constructed formats, a Contraption deck must have at least fifteen different Contraption cards and no more than one of each.
2018/01/19: In Limited formats, a Contraption deck may include any number of Contraption cards in your card pool. You don't have to include every Contraption card you draft or open in sealed deck. In those formats, your Contraption deck may include duplicates.
2018/01/19: In silver-bordered games using Contraptions, you have three sprockets, illustrated on the back of Contraption cards. At the start of the game, put a CRANK! counter on sprocket 3.
2018/01/19: While Contraptions you control are on the battlefield, the Contraption deck is not, even if you are using it to signify the three sprockets.
