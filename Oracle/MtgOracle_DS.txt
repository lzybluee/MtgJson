<Multiverseid>49839</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/12/01: <Neurok Transmuter>'s second ability removes the type "artifact" — and any artifact subtypes — from the artifact creature it targets. It doesn't remove any other types or any subtypes of other types, and it doesn't remove supertypes. If the artifact was legendary, it's still legendary, and the "Legend rule" applies normally.
2004/12/01: Equipment that stops being an artifact loses the subtype "Equipment." Permanents without the subtype Equipment can't equip creatures. Of course, artifact creatures can't equip anything either.
2004/12/01: <Neurok Transmuter>'s second ability interacts strangely with March of the Machines from the Mirrodin set. If an artifact is an artifact creature only because March of the Machines is on the battlefield and you then activate <Neurok Transmuter>'s second ability on that artifact creature, the result is a permanent with no types whatsoever. <Neurok Transmuter>'s ability removes the type "artifact." March of the Machines depends on knowing what is and isn't an artifact. The permanent won't be an artifact when March of the Machine's effect is applied and therefore it won't be turned into a creature.</Rulings>

2004/12/01: You can put +1/+1 counters on a noncreature artifact. They won't do anything unless the artifact becomes a creature, at which time they'll add to the creature's power and toughness.

If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: <Echoing Courage> has only one target. Other creatures with that name are not targeted. For example, a creature with protection from green will still get +2/+2 if it has the same name as the target creature.
2018/03/16: If the target creature is an illegal target by the time <Echoing Courage> tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. No creatures get +2/+2.
2018/03/16: The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types it was created with, unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gave it a different name. For example, a 1/1 Cat Soldier creature token is named "Cat Soldier."
2018/03/16: A face-down creature has no name, so it can't share a name with anything. This includes other creatures with no name.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: The Lattice's first ability causes Auras to become artifacts. Combined with March of the Machines from the Mirrodin set, this can then make those Auras become creatures.

<Artist>Glen Angus</Artist>
<Multiverseid>47930</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/12/01: As <Panoptic Mirror>'s triggered ability resolves, it allows you to create a copy of one of the instant or sorcery cards imprinted on <Panoptic Mirror> in the Exile zone (that's where the imprinted card is) and then cast it without paying its mana cost.
2004/12/01: You don't pay the spell's mana cost. If the spell has X in its mana cost, X is 0. You do pay any additional costs for that spell. You can't use any alternative costs.
2004/12/01: The triggered ability triggers only once each upkeep, not once per imprinted card. If no cards are imprinted on <Panoptic Mirror> when the triggered ability resolves, it does nothing.
2004/12/01: You may imprint a card on <Panoptic Mirror> in response to the upkeep-triggered ability. If you do, that card is available to copy when the triggered ability resolves.
2004/12/01: Exiling a card when the activated ability resolves is optional. If you choose to exile a card, you can exile only a card with converted mana cost equal to X.
2005/03/01: The creation of the copy and then the casting of the copy are both optional.
2017/04/18: To imprint a split card, you pay X equal to card's converted mana cost, determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. If the copied card is a split card, you choose which one side of it to cast, but you can't cast both sides.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: You can use <Serum Powder>'s second ability only while it's in your hand. If this card is in your hand, you can choose either to mulligan or to use <Serum Powder>'s ability. Using the ability doesn't prevent you from taking further mulligans, and taking a mulligan doesn't prevent you from using a <Serum Powder>'s ability if you happen to draw one in your new hand.
2017/11/17: Unlike a normal mulligan, <Serum Powder> lets you draw the same number of cards that were in your hand, not one less. If you have already taken one mulligan and your hand contains six cards including a <Serum Powder>, you can choose to exile those six cards and draw six new cards.
2017/11/17: The cards in your hand are exiled for the rest of the game; they aren't shuffled back into your library if you take another mulligan. Cards exiled are always face up unless the effect that exiled them says they aren't. Be sure to return those cards to your deck for your next game.</Rulings>

Next apply any cost reducers. Finally look at the amount of mana you have to pay. If it's less than three mana, you'll pay three mana.
2004/12/01: Even with a cost reducer on the battlefield, spells can't cost less than three mana to cast.
2004/12/01: If a spell costs at least three mana due to additional costs, such as kicker costs, that's fine.
2004/12/01: You still need to pay any additional nonmana costs the spell has, such as sacrificing a creature or discarding cards.
2004/12/01: Casting a creature with morph face down already costs three mana, even though the converted mana cost of the face-down spell is zero, so <Trinisphere> normally doesn't modify the total cost of a face-down creature spell. However, if Dream Chisel is reducing that cost while <Trinisphere> is on the battlefield, you'll still have to pay three mana for the spell.</Rulings>
