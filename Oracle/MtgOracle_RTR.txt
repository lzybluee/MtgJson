<Rulings>2012/10/01: If <Angel of Serenity> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability has resolved, its leaves-the-battlefield ability will trigger and do nothing. Then the enters-the-battlefield ability will resolve and exile the targeted creatures and/or creature cards indefinitely.
2013/01/24: You choose up to three total targets from among other creatures on the battlefield and creature cards in graveyards. You may choose zero targets.
2013/01/24: You choose the targets as part of putting the enters-the-battlefield trigger on the stack. Because that ability includes "you may," you choose whether to exile the targets when the ability resolves.
2013/01/24: If a creature targeted by the enters-the-battlefield ability dies before that ability resolves, it will become an illegal target even though it may be a creature card in a graveyard when the ability resolves. It won't be exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: You must target a creature to cast <Trostani's Judgment>. If that creature is an illegal target when <Trostani's Judgment> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't populate.
2012/10/01: If you choose a creature token you control as the target, it will be exiled before you populate and you won't be able to choose that creature to copy.
2013/04/15: You can choose any creature token you control for populate. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers' Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
2013/04/15: The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
2013/04/15: The new token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.
2013/04/15: If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: The only legal target for <Conjured Currency>'s ability is a permanent both owned and controlled by another player, although it doesn't have to be the same player. For example, a permanent owned by an opponent but controlled by your teammate (or another opponent) could be chosen as the target.
2012/10/01: The exchange occurs only if <Conjured Currency> and the target permanent are both on the battlefield and controlled by different players when the ability resolves. In addition, the target permanent must be one you neither own nor control. If any of these things aren't true when the ability tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen and neither permanent will change controllers.
2012/10/01: You don't necessarily have to control <Conjured Currency> when its ability resolves in order for the exchange to happen. If another player has gained control of <Conjured Currency> while the ability is on the stack, and a third player controls the target (and you don't own it), you may choose to have those two players exchange control of the relevant permanents.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: Jace's first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers whenever a creature an opponent controls attacks. It doesn't matter which player or planeswalker that creature is attacking.
2012/10/01: You pick one of your opponents when Jace's second ability resolves. The ability doesn't target that opponent. All players may see the revealed cards and offer opinions. You (not your opponent) choose which pile is put into your hand and which pile is put on the bottom of your library.
2012/10/01: Piles can be empty. If one of the piles is empty, you choose to put all the revealed cards in your hand or on the bottom of your library.
2012/10/01: When resolving Jace's third ability, you search each player's library (including yours) and exile the nonland cards before casting any of them.
2012/10/01: For each library, the search is complete only when you explicitly say it is. For example, you can look through one player's library, set that library down, look at another player's library, choose a nonland card in the first library, then choose a nonland card in the second library. Don't reveal any cards from those libraries to any other player until you exile them.
2012/10/01: You cast the cards by putting them on the stack one at a time, choosing modes, targets, and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve.
2012/10/01: When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2012/10/01: If you can't cast a card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast one, it will remain exiled. Jace's ability won't allow you to cast it later.
2012/10/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2012/10/01: If a card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: <Grave Betrayal> doesn't overwrite any previous colors or types. Rather, it adds another color and another creature type.
2012/10/01: If the creature is normally colorless, it will simply be black. It won't be both black and colorless.
2012/10/01: If a creature you don't control dies during the end step, that creature won't return to the battlefield until the beginning of the next end step.
2012/10/01: Each creature you don't control that dies causes a delayed triggered ability to trigger at the beginning of the next end step. If there are multiple such abilities, you can put them on the stack in any order. The creatures will return to the battlefield one at a time as each ability resolves. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2012/10/01: If the creature card leaves the graveyard before the delayed triggered ability resolves, it won't return to the battlefield. This is also true if the card leaves the graveyard and returns to the graveyard before that ability resolves.
2012/10/01: The phrase "with an additional +1/+1 counter on it" means that the creature enters the battlefield with one more +1/+1 counter than it would normally enter the battlefield with. It doesn't keep any counters it had on it when it died.
2012/10/01: In a multiplayer game, if more than one player controls a <Grave Betrayal> and a creature controlled by none of those players dies, each <Grave Betrayal> will create a delayed triggered ability at the beginning of the next end step. The first such ability to resolve will return the creature. Usually, this will be one controlled by the player furthest from the active player in turn order.</Rulings>

2012/10/01: The controller of a creature that attacks if able still chooses which player or planeswalker it attacks.

If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.

2012/10/01: The enters-the-battlefield ability has only one target. The other permanents with that name aren't targeted. For example, a permanent with protection from white will be exiled if it has the same name as the target nonland permanent.
2012/10/01: If the target nonland permanent is an illegal target when the enters-the-battlefield ability tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No permanents will be exiled, including those with the same name as the target.
2012/10/01: If <Detention Sphere> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability has resolved, its leaves-the-battlefield ability will trigger and do nothing. Then the enters-the-battlefield ability will resolve and exile the targeted nonland permanent and other permanents with that name indefinitely.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: Spells and abilities that would cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part has no effect.
2012/10/01: Effects that would replace gaining life with another effect won't apply because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2012/10/01: If an effect says to set a player's life total to a certain number and that number is higher than the player's current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than the player's current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2012/10/01: The amount of life lost is calculated when the triggered ability resolves. For example, if a player has 20 life and there are two <Havoc Festival>s on the battlefield, the first ability will cause that player to lose 10 life and then the second ability will cause that player to lose 5 life.
2012/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability triggers for each player. Any life loss is applied to the team's life total. For example, if the team has 30 life, the first ability will cause the player (and thus the team) to lose 15 life and then the second ability will cause the other player (and thus the team) to lose 8 life. The team will end up having 7 life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: <Nivix Guildmage>'s second ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2012/10/01: When the second ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/10/01: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2012/10/01: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Sphinx's Revelation does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/10/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you copy a spell that you cast by paying its overload cost, the copy will resolve as though its overload cost had been paid as well.</Rulings>

2012/10/01: Rakdos's last ability can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a creature spell you cast.
