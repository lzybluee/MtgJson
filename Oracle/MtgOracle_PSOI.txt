Delirium — Whenever Angel of Deliverance deals damage, if there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard, exile target creature an opponent controls.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: If <Angel of Deliverance> deals damage to multiple creatures, players, or planeswalkers at once (for example, if it's blocked by two smaller creatures) its last ability triggers only once.
2016/04/08: If <Angel of Deliverance> deals damage and is dealt lethal damage at the same time, its ability will trigger.
2016/04/08: If <Angel of Deliverance> deals lethal damage to a creature, that creature can't be targeted by <Angel of Deliverance>'s triggered ability. It's already in its owner's graveyard.
2016/04/08: If you have three noncreature card types among cards in your graveyard and <Angel of Deliverance> deals damage at the same time another creature you control is dealt lethal damage, the ability won't trigger. The creature doesn't die until after <Angel of Deliverance>'s ability checks to see if it triggers.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: Casting a spell for an alternative cost, such as a madness cost, doesn't change its converted mana cost. For example, casting Twins of Maurer Estate (a card with mana cost {4}{B} and madness cost {2}{B}) for its madness cost will not cause <Bygone Bishop>'s ability to trigger.
2016/04/08: The token is named Clue and has the artifact subtype Clue. Clue isn't a creature type.
2016/04/08: The tokens are normal artifacts. For example, they can be sacrificed to cast Angelic Purge or targeted by Root Out.

<Rulings>2016/04/08: If you have three non-sorcery card types among cards in your graveyard at the time <Descend upon the Sinful> resolves, you won't get an Angel token. <Descend upon the Sinful> isn't put into your graveyard until after it's finished resolving.
2016/04/08: If one of those creatures was enchanted, its Aura won't be put into a player's graveyard until after <Descend upon the Sinful> has finished resolving. If the controller of <Descend upon the Sinful> owned the Aura, it won't be in the graveyard in time to be counted for the delirium ability.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.

2016/04/08: If a spell or ability causes you to draw cards and then discard cards, <Geralf's Masterpiece> may have a toughness of 0 while you choose which cards to discard. As long as it has toughness 1 or greater again after the spell or ability resolves, it will survive.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: Skulk matters only as blockers are chosen. Modifying either creature's power after blockers are chosen won't cause the attacking creature to become unblocked.

A creature with skulk and 0 or less power most likely won't be blocked, but it won't deal combat damage and won't trigger any abilities that trigger when combat damage is dealt.

<Artist>David Palumbo</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The toughness of the creature is checked only as <Welcome to the Fold> resolves. It doesn't matter if it has higher toughness as you cast <Welcome to the Fold>, or if its toughness becomes higher after <Welcome to the Fold> has resolved.
2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time.

<Artist>Bastien L. Deharme</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The upkeep step is before the draw step, after the untap step. <Asylum Visitor>'s first ability will trigger and resolve before the active player draws a card in their draw step if that player has no cards in hand.
2016/04/08: <Asylum Visitor>'s triggered ability checks the active player's hand as the upkeep begins and as the trigger resolves. If that player has a card in hand as it resolves, you won't draw a card or lose 1 life. Notably, if you control multiple <Asylum Visitor>s during your upkeep, whichever one's first ability resolves first will stop the other's first ability from having any effect unless you have a way to get the card you drew out of your hand before it resolves.
2016/04/08: On an opponent's turn, triggered abilities you control will resolve before any triggered abilities of permanents that opponent controls if they trigger at the same time. This means that if you and your opponent each control an <Asylum Visitor> during your opponent's upkeep, and they have no cards in hand, you'll always draw a card before your opponent has a card in their hand.
2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.

When Mindwrack Demon enters the battlefield, put the top four cards of your library into your graveyard.
Delirium — At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 4 life unless there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard.</CardText>
<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: <Mindwrack Demon>'s delirium triggered ability does not include an intervening "if" clause. This ability triggers at the beginning of your upkeep regardless of the number of types in your graveyard, and it checks that number as it resolves to determine whether you lose 4 life or not.
2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
2016/04/08: The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, Wicker Witch (an artifact creature) along with Catalog (an instant) and Chaplain's Blessing (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
2016/04/08: Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
2016/04/08: In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: If the delirium ability applies, that player must sacrifice a creature object and a planeswalker object if able. In the unusual case that the player controls a single permanent that's both a creature and a planeswalker, that player must sacrifice another creature or planeswalker (unless they control no other creatures and no other planeswalkers).

Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.
2016/04/08: Some delirium abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." These spells have an upgraded effect when they resolve if there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard. They check that number only while they're resolving and don't count themselves, since they aren't in your graveyard yet. You only get the upgraded effect, not both effects.</Rulings>

2016/04/08: Cards are discarded in a Magic game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
2016/04/08: A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
2016/04/08: Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
2016/04/08: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
2016/04/08: Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
2016/04/08: When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
2016/04/08: If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/04/08: The card types in Magic are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: <Altered Ego> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/04/08: If you copy a double-faced creature, <Altered Ego> will be a copy of the face that's up when <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield. Because <Altered Ego> is not a double-faced card, it won't be able to transform. If an effect instructs you to return it to the battlefield transformed when it leaves the battlefield, it won't return and will remain in its new zone.
2016/04/08: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, that X is considered to be 0. The value of X in <Altered Ego>'s last ability will be whatever value was chosen for X while casting <Altered Ego>.
2016/04/08: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Altered Ego>), then your <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
2016/04/08: If the chosen creature is a token, <Altered Ego> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Altered Ego> isn't a token.
2016/04/08: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2016/04/08: If <Altered Ego> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Altered Ego> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2016/04/08: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Altered Ego> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately. It won't have +1/+1 counters placed on it by its ability.
2016/04/08: X can be 0. <Altered Ego> won't enter with any additional +1/+1 counters, and it will just be a copy of the chosen creature.</Rulings>

<Artist>Winona Nelson</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: When the ability that transforms Arlinn Kord into <Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon> (or vice versa) resolves, the number of loyalty counters on her doesn't change.
2016/04/08: You can't activate Arlinn Kord's second ability and, after she transforms, activate a loyalty ability of <Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon> during that turn (or vice versa).
2016/04/08: <Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon> is not a Werewolf card; that is, she doesn't have the creature type Werewolf. Spells and abilities that refer to Werewolf cards or Werewolves don't apply to Arlinn.
2016/04/08: The set of creatures affected by the first ability of <Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon> is determined as the ability resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1 or gain trample.
2016/04/08: Arlinn Kord is not a Werewolf card; that is, she doesn't have the creature type Werewolf. Spells and abilities that refer to Werewolf cards or Werewolves don't apply to Arlinn.
2016/04/08: The emblem grants the activated ability to your creatures. Use the power of the creature as the activated ability resolves to determine how much damage is dealt. If the creature isn't on the battlefield at that time, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield. Note that this works differently than the fight keyword action, which requires both creatures to be on the battlefield for any damage to be dealt.
2016/04/08: You can activate the first ability of Arlinn Kord without any targets just to add a loyalty counter to her.
