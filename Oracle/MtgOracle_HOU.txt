<Rulings>2018/03/16: You can cast <Act of Heroism> even if the target creature won't be able to block right away, perhaps because you're the attacking player.
2018/03/16: Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
2018/03/16: <Act of Heroism> can target an untapped creature. It still gets +2/+2 and can block an additional creature.
2018/03/16: The effects of <Act of Heroism> are cumulative. If multiples resolve targeting the same creature, that creature can block that many additional creatures this turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430691</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: For each card with eternalize, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Hour of Devastation booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with eternalize; you can use the same items to represent an eternalized token as you would any other token.
2017/07/14: If a creature card with eternalize is put into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately afterward. You can activate its eternalize ability before any player can try to exile it, such as with Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an eternalize ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics specifically modified by eternalize. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is black instead of its other colors. Its base power and toughness are 4/4. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.</Rulings>

2017/07/14: If <Angel of Condemnation> leaves the battlefield before its last ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.

2017/07/14: Tapping <Angel of Condemnation> to activate either of its abilities while it's attacking doesn't remove it from combat.
2017/07/14: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.

<Rulings>2017/07/14: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creatures no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change their power and/or toughness.
2017/07/14: If an effect grants a creature an ability after <Overwhelming Splendor> has become attached to its controller, that creature won't lose that ability.
2017/07/14: If a noncreature permanent becomes a creature, it will lose all abilities it has. However, if the effect that makes that permanent a creature grants it an ability, it will continue to have that ability. For example, the enchanted player's Riddleform will have flying once it becomes a creature.
2017/07/14: <Overwhelming Splendor> overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply to a creature after <Overwhelming Splendor> becomes attached to its controller will overwrite this effect. For example, the enchanted player's Riddleform will become a 3/3 creature if player casts a noncreature spell.
2017/07/14: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip and eternalize) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") of noncreature permanents are unaffected by the last ability of <Overwhelming Splendor>.
2017/07/14: An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate. A loyalty ability is an ability of a planeswalker whose cost specifies how many loyalty counters to give or remove.
2017/07/14: While the enchanted player can still activate mana abilities and loyalty abilities, creatures that player controls won't normally have any of those abilities to be activated.
2017/07/14: If <Overwhelming Splendor> leaves the battlefield at the same time as a creature enchanted player controls, any "when [this creature] [dies or leaves the battlefield]" abilities of that creature won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a creature enters the battlefield under enchanted player's control, any "when [this creature] enters the battlefield" abilities of that creature won't trigger. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities won't be applied. This is a change from previous rulings.</Rulings>

2017/07/14: If a replacement effect allows a player to modify or replace an event by putting counters on an artifact, creature, enchantment, or land, that player may apply that replacement effect. Counters won't be put on the object, but if the original event is entirely replaced (such as by applying Soul-Scar Mage's replacement effect), the original event won't happen.
2017/07/14: If an artifact, creature, enchantment, or land would enter the battlefield with counters on it at the same time that <Solemnity> enters the battlefield, <Solemnity> doesn't stop it from getting those counters.
2017/07/14: Damage from a source with wither has no effect on creatures. No -1/-1 counters are put on them, and no damage is marked on them. The damage is still dealt for purposes of effects that care about damage, such as lifelink.
2017/07/14: Damage from a source with infect has no effect on creatures or players. No -1/-1 counters are put on creatures, and no damage is marked on them. Players don't get poison counters and they don't lose life. The damage is still dealt for purposes of effects that care about damage, such as lifelink.
2017/07/14: Counters can be put on cards that aren't on the battlefield. Notably, suspended cards will still get time counters.
2017/07/14: If a creature with tribute is entering the battlefield, the chosen opponent can't pay tribute even if they want to.
2017/07/14: While resolving a cumulative upkeep trigger of a permanent, you'll fail to put a counter on that permanent, then you may pay for the age counters already on it. If it has no age counters on it, you may pay {0}.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>430729</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2017/04/18: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.
2017/04/18: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/07/14: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.
2017/07/14: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as prowess and afflict, are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
2017/07/14: If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
2017/07/14: Mana abilities can't be targeted. An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
2017/07/14: Activated abilities are written in the form "Cost: Effect." Some keyword abilities, such as equip and eternalize, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/04/18: An ability that triggers whenever you discard a card doesn't give you permission to discard cards. You'll need another effect that instructs or allows you to discard them.
2017/04/18: An ability that triggers whenever you "cycle or discard" a card triggers only once if you cycle a card. The ability "Whenever you discard a card" is functionally identical to this ability; cycling is mentioned for clarity.
2017/04/18: If a player discards a card during their cleanup step due to having too many cards in hand, any appropriate abilities that trigger on discarding that card trigger. If this happens, those triggered abilities are put onto the stack and players receive priority in that cleanup step to cast spells or activate abilities (normally, no players may take actions during a cleanup step). Another cleanup step is created following that one.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/07/14: <Swarm Intelligence> can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2017/07/14: <Swarm Intelligence> can copy the spell even if it's countered before <Swarm Intelligence>'s triggered ability resolves.
2017/07/14: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as <Swarm Intelligence>'s own ability) won't trigger.
2017/07/14: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/07/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2017/07/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Torment of Hailfire does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/07/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Chandra's Pyrohelix), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/07/14: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

2017/07/14: Unesh's cost-reduction ability doesn't reduce the cost to cast itself.
2017/07/14: You (not your opponent) choose which pile to put into your hand and which to put into your graveyard.

2017/07/14: If you choose <Doomfall>'s second mode, you must exile a nonland card from that player's hand if able. If you can't, most likely because that player's hand contains only land cards, nothing happens. That player won't exile a creature they control instead.</Rulings>

Eternalize {4}{B}{B} ({4}{B}{B}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a 4/4 black Zombie Human Wizard with no mana cost. Eternalize only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Yongjae Choi</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430752</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: For each card with eternalize, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Hour of Devastation booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with eternalize; you can use the same items to represent an eternalized token as you would any other token.
2017/07/14: If a creature card with eternalize is put into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately afterward. You can activate its eternalize ability before any player can try to exile it, such as with Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an eternalize ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics specifically modified by eternalize. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is black instead of its other colors. Its base power and toughness are 4/4. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/04/18: An ability that triggers whenever you discard a card doesn't give you permission to discard cards. You'll need another effect that instructs or allows you to discard them.
2017/04/18: An ability that triggers whenever you "cycle or discard" a card triggers only once if you cycle a card. The ability "Whenever you discard a card" is functionally identical to this ability; cycling is mentioned for clarity.
2017/04/18: If a player discards a card during their cleanup step due to having too many cards in hand, any appropriate abilities that trigger on discarding that card trigger. If this happens, those triggered abilities are put onto the stack and players receive priority in that cleanup step to cast spells or activate abilities (normally, no players may take actions during a cleanup step). Another cleanup step is created following that one.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/07/14: If X is 0, <Torment of Hailfire> resolves with no effect.
2017/07/14: While resolving <Torment of Hailfire>, your opponent chooses a card to be discarded without revealing it, chooses a nonland permanent to be sacrificed, or chooses to do neither. Then that player discards that card, sacrifices that permanent, or loses 3 life, then repeats this process if it hasn't been done X times yet. Your opponent can always choose to lose 3 life, even if they have cards to discard or nonland permanents to sacrifice.
2017/07/14: Each repetition through this process is done separately. If an opponent sacrifices a creature with an ability that triggers when another creature dies, for example, it will see creatures that are sacrificed before it, but not those are sacrificed after it.
2017/07/14: State-based actions aren't checked in between repetitions of this process, so the game state may be a little unusual while making the choice. For example, a player may sacrifice a creature and then later sacrifice an Aura that was attached to that creature.
2017/07/14: In a multiplayer game, each opponent in turn order makes their choice once, then all of the actions occur simultaneously, then they repeat this process if it hasn't been done X times yet. Opponents will know choices made by earlier opponents when making their choices, although a card chosen to be discarded this way isn't revealed until it's discarded.
2017/07/14: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Torment of Hailfire> causes both opponents to sacrifice a nonland permanent, discard a card, or lose 3 life X times. Your opponents can choose the same torment or different ones each time.</Rulings>

When Earthshaker Khenra enters the battlefield, target creature with power less than or equal to Earthshaker Khenra's power can't block this turn.
Eternalize {4}{R}{R} ({4}{R}{R}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a 4/4 black Zombie Jackal Warrior with no mana cost. Eternalize only as a sorcery.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jason A. Engle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430779</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: The target creature's power is checked when you target it with <Earthshaker Khenra>'s ability and when that ability resolves. Once the ability resolves, if the creature's power increases or <Earthshaker Khenra>'s power decreases, the target creature will still be unable to block.
2017/07/14: Spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities can't raise <Earthshaker Khenra>'s power before you have to choose a target for its ability. Static abilities, such as that of Lord of the Accursed, will raise its power in time to let you target a larger creature.
2017/07/14: For each card with eternalize, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Hour of Devastation booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with eternalize; you can use the same items to represent an eternalized token as you would any other token.
2017/07/14: If a creature card with eternalize is put into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately afterward. You can activate its eternalize ability before any player can try to exile it, such as with Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an eternalize ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics specifically modified by eternalize. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is black instead of its other colors. Its base power and toughness are 4/4. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.</Rulings>

2017/07/14: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/07/14: If any abilities trigger as you cast any of those cards, they won't be put on the stack until after you're done casting them. They'll resolve before any of those spells.
2017/07/14: If you cast any of those cards, you do so as part of the resolution of <Hazoret's Undying Fury>. You can't wait to cast them later in the turn.
2017/07/14: If a spell you cast this way targets another spell, it may target a spell you cast earlier during the resolution of <Hazoret's Undying Fury>. It may target <Hazoret's Undying Fury> as well, but <Hazoret's Undying Fury> will be put into your graveyard soon afterwards and the spell's target will become illegal.

<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430798</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: An ability that triggers when something "attacks and isn't blocked" triggers in the declare blockers step after blockers are declared if (1) that creature is attacking and (2) no creatures are declared to block it. It will trigger even if that creature was put onto the battlefield attacking rather than having been declared as an attacker in the declare attackers step.
2017/07/14: <Wildfire Eternal>'s second ability resolves before combat damage is dealt, and you must cast a spell at that time if you wish to cast one without paying its mana cost. You can cast a sorcery during the declare blockers step this way.
2017/07/14: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
2017/07/14: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/07/14: If multiple creatures block a creature with afflict, afflict triggers only once.
2017/07/14: Afflict causes the defending player to lose life; it's not damage or combat damage.
2017/07/14: If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, that planeswalker's controller is the defending player.
2017/07/14: Afflict resolves before combat damage is dealt. If this loss of life brings a player to 0 life or less, that player loses the game immediately. A blocking creature with lifelink won't deal combat damage in time to save that player.</Rulings>

<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430820</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: The value of X is determined only as <Resilient Khenra>'s triggered ability resolves. Once that happens, the value of X won't change later in the turn even if <Resilient Khenra>'s power changes.
2017/07/14: If <Resilient Khenra> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine the value of X.
2017/07/14: If <Resilient Khenra>'s power is negative as its triggered ability resolves, X is considered to be 0. (This is a change from previous rules.)
2017/07/14: For each card with eternalize, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some Hour of Devastation booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with eternalize; you can use the same items to represent an eternalized token as you would any other token.
2017/07/14: If a creature card with eternalize is put into your graveyard during your main phase, you'll have priority immediately afterward. You can activate its eternalize ability before any player can try to exile it, such as with Crook of Condemnation, if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've activated an eternalize ability, the card is immediately exiled. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics specifically modified by eternalize. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is black instead of its other colors. Its base power and toughness are 4/4. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
2017/04/18: If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.
2017/04/18: All cards in the Amonkhet set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature, as do some of the cards in the Hour of Devastation set. You can't do so later in combat, and creatures put onto the battlefield attacking can't be exerted. Any abilities that trigger on exerting an attacking creature will resolve before blockers are declared.
2017/07/14: Once a creature with power 3 or greater has blocked an exerted <Rhonas's Stalwart>, changing the power of the blocking creature won't cause <Rhonas's Stalwart> to become unblocked.</Rulings>

2017/07/14: If you don't cast the card exiled by Nicol Bolas's first ability that turn, it will remain exiled.
2017/07/14: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, you must pay those to cast the card.

<Rulings>2017/07/14: The number of Zombies you control is counted as <The Scarab God>'s first ability resolves. Players can try to change that number in response to the ability (perhaps by activating its second ability).
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics it specifically modifies. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into its owner's graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie instead of its other types (unlike Zombies created by an eternalize ability) and is black instead of its other colors. Its power and toughness are 4/4. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: Unlike the tokens created by an eternalize ability, this token has the mana cost and thus converted mana cost of the card it's copying.
2017/07/14: If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.

The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.

2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.

This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
2017/04/18: A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
2017/04/18: If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
2017/04/18: All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined of Destined // Lead, but not Lead.
2017/04/18: Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined // Lead counts once, not twice.
2017/04/18: Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
2017/07/14: If you resolve multiples of <Driven> or of Despair in one turn, your creatures have that many instances of the appropriate triggered ability. Each instance triggers separately.
2017/07/14: Multiple instances of trample or menace are redundant.
2017/07/14: <Driven> and Despair each affect only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't gain the keyword ability or the triggered ability.
2017/07/14: Once you've started to cast a spell with aftermath from your graveyard, the card is immediately moved to the stack. Opponents can't try to stop the ability by exiling the card with an effect such as that of Crook of Condemnation.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/04/18: While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined // Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
2017/04/18: If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.

If you cycle a noninstant card without flash, you can't cast it until after the cycling ability has resolved.

<Rulings>2017/07/14: The ability of <God-Pharaoh's Gift> doesn't target the creature card you'll exile. You choose one as the ability resolves. No player may take actions between the time you choose a creature card to exile and the time you create the token.
2017/07/14: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else, except the characteristics it specifically modifies. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
2017/07/14: The token is a Zombie instead of its other types (unlike Zombies created by an eternalize ability) and is black instead of its other colors. Its power and toughness are 4/4. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
2017/07/14: Unlike the tokens created by an eternalize ability, this token has the mana cost and thus converted mana cost of the card it's copying.

<Rulings>2017/07/14: Once <Mirage Mirror>'s ability resolves, it no longer has that ability.
2017/07/14: <Mirage Mirror> copies the printed values of the target permanent, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that permanent or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target permanent become a creature.
2017/07/14: If <Mirage Mirror> copies a permanent that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
2017/07/14: If you activate <Mirage Mirror>'s ability multiple times in a turn in response to itself, then each time one of those abilities resolves, it will overwrite whatever <Mirage Mirror> is copying. <Mirage Mirror> will wind up as a copy of the permanent targeted by the last ability to resolve. When the turn ends, all instances of the ability will wear off at the same time.
2017/07/14: If an effect begins to apply to <Mirage Mirror> before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply. For example, if <Mirage Mirror> is activated twice in response to itself targeting first Rampaging Hippo then Frilled Sandwalla, the ability it has while it's a copy of Frilled Sandwalla can be activated and its effect will continue to apply while <Mirage Mirror> is a copy of Rampaging Hippo.
2017/07/14: If <Mirage Mirror> becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (if it gains any) unless it has haste.
2017/07/14: If <Mirage Mirror> becomes a copy of a legendary permanent you control, you'll put one of them into your graveyard.
2017/07/14: If <Mirage Mirror> becomes a copy of an Aura, it's put into its owner's graveyard unless it's somehow attached to an appropriate object or player already. If it becomes a copy of an Equipment and is attached to a creature, it'll become unattached when it becomes a non-Equipment artifact again.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/07/14: While resolving Nicol Bolas's first ability, your opponent chooses a card to be discarded without revealing it, chooses a nonland permanent to be sacrificed, or chooses to do neither. Then that player discards that card, sacrifices that permanent, or loses 3 life. Your opponent can always choose to lose 3 life, even if they have cards to discard or nonland permanents to sacrifice.
2017/07/14: In a multiplayer game, each opponent in turn order makes their choice for Nicol Bolas's first ability, then all of the actions occur simultaneously. Opponents will know choices made by earlier opponents when making their choices, although a card chosen to be discarded this way isn't revealed until it's discarded.
2017/07/14: If the target of Nicol Bolas's second ability becomes illegal, the ability doesn't resolve and you won't draw a card. If that target is legal but can't be destroyed, most likely because it has indestructible, you still draw a card.
2017/07/14: If Nicol Bolas's third ability causes each opponent to have 0 or less life, but it also causes you to try to draw more cards than you have in your library, the game ends in a draw.</Rulings>
