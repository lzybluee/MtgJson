<Rulings>2016/06/08: If no card is imprinted on <Chrome Mox>, it can't add mana to your mana pool. It can never add colorless mana to your mana pool, even if the imprinted card has a colorless mana symbol in its mana cost.

<CardText>Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage, put two charge counters on Umezawa's Jitte.
Remove a charge counter from Umezawa's Jitte: Choose one —
• Equipped creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.
• Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
• You gain 2 life.
Equip {2}</CardText>
<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Rulings>2005/02/01: <Umezawa's Jitte>'s activated ability generates a modal choice. The choice is made when the ability is activated.
2005/02/01: If the "target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn" mode is chosen, the target creature must also be announced.
2005/02/01: The ability can be used any time <Umezawa's Jitte>'s controller has priority — only the "target creature" choice has additional requirements. Choosing the "Equipped creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn" mode does nothing if the Jitte isn't equipped to a creature when the ability resolves.
2005/02/01: If the Jitte is moved after the "+2/+2" mode is announced but before it resolves, the bonus is given to the creature that is equipped when the ability resolves.
2005/02/01: If the Jitte leaves the battlefield after the "+2/+2" mode is announced but before it resolves, the bonus is given to the creature that was most recently equipped once the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: <Maelstrom Pulse> has only one target. If that permanent is an illegal target as <Maelstrom Pulse> tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. Nothing will be destroyed.
2009/05/01: The name of a creature token is the same as its creature types unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 Soldier creature token is named "Soldier."
2009/05/01: A face-down creature has no name, so it doesn't have the same name as anything else.
2013/07/01: If <Maelstrom Pulse> resolves but the targeted permanent isn't destroyed (perhaps because it regenerates or has indestructible), all other permanents with the same name as it will still be destroyed (unless they also have indestructible.</Rulings>

<Artist>Terese Nielsen</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2009/10/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.
2017/11/17: <Lotus Cobra>'s ability isn't a mana ability. Opponents may respond to it before you have that mana.</Rulings>

—Javad Nasrin, Ondu relic hunter</Flavor>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: A colored permanent is a permanent with at least one colored mana symbol in its mana cost. Note that effects may cause a colored permanent to become colorless (as Moonlace could), or a colorless permanent to become colored (as Crimson Wisps could).
2010/06/15: Tokens may also be colored permanents. The effect that creates a token states what color it is or whether it's colorless.
2010/06/15: Lands have no mana cost, so they are colorless unless an effect states otherwise.
2010/06/15: All the colored permanents are sacrificed at the same time.
2013/07/01: <All Is Dust> doesn't destroy permanents. Rather, it causes them to be sacrificed. Regeneration, totem armor, and indestructibile can't save permanents from <All Is Dust>.</Rulings>
