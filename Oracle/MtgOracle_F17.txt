2016/07/13: In a multiplayer game, the targeted opponent may choose what information to share with others if that player wants advice on how to split the cards, but that player doesn't have to share any information at all.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: If the target creature becomes an illegal target before <Unlicensed Disintegration> resolves, the spell doesn't resolve. No player is dealt damage.
2016/09/20: If the target creature is a legal target but isn't destroyed by <Unlicensed Disintegration>, most likely because it has indestructible, <Unlicensed Disintegration> still deals 3 damage to the creature's controller.
2016/09/20: Whether or not you control an artifact is checked only as <Unlicensed Disintegration> resolves, after the creature is destroyed. For example, if you destroy a Fairgrounds Warden that exiled your artifact creature, <Unlicensed Disintegration> deals 3 damage to Fairgrounds Warden's controller.</Rulings>

<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: {E} is the energy symbol. It represents one energy counter.
2017/02/09: Energy counters are a kind of counter that a player may have. They're not associated with specific permanents. (Other kinds of counters that players may have include poison and experience.)
2017/02/09: Keep careful track of how many energy counters each player has. You may do so by keeping a running count on paper, by using a die, or by any other clear and mutually agreeable method.
2017/02/09: If an effect says you get one or more {E}, you get that many energy counters. To pay one or more {E}, you lose that many energy counters. Any effects that interact with counters a player gets, has, or loses can interact with energy counters.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't mana. They don't go away as steps, phases, and turns end, and effects that add mana "of any type" can't give you energy counters.
2017/02/09: You can't pay more energy counters than you have.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Kang</Artist>
<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/07/13: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't pay for {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, or {C} mana symbols in a spell's total cost.
2018/07/13: Improvise can't be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can't be used during the resolution of an ability that says "Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}."
2018/07/13: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
2018/07/13: Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
2018/07/13: Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.
2018/07/13: When using improvise to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Saheeli's Directive and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{R}{R}{R}. If you tap two artifacts, you'll have to pay {1}{R}{R}{R}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/02/09: <Fatal Push> can target any creature, even one with converted mana cost 5 or greater. The creature's converted mana cost is checked only as <Fatal Push> resolves.
2017/02/09: If the mana cost of a creature on the battlefield includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.</Rulings>

<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2017/02/09: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2017/02/09: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {1}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 3.
2017/02/09: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.
2017/02/09: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2017/02/09: You can target any permanent card in your graveyard with converted mana cost 2 or less, not just one that was put there from the battlefield this turn.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
2017/02/09: Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
2017/02/09: Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: Energy counters aren't permanents. Paying {E} won't satisfy a revolt ability.
2017/02/09: All cards in the Aether Revolt set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening "if" clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.</Rulings>
