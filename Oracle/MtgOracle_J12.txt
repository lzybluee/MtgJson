Sacrifice Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed: Return target black card from your graveyard to your hand. Activate this ability only during your turn, before attackers are declared.</CardText>

<Watermark>Wotc</Watermark>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: Despite the similarities between horsemanship and flying, horsemanship doesn't interact with flying or reach.
2009/10/01: You can't activate Xiahou Dun's ability to return Xiahou Dun itself to your hand. You must choose a target before you sacrifice Xiahou Dun, so it's not a black card in your graveyard yet.
2013/09/20: If a turn has multiple combat phases, the ability can only be activated before the beginning of the declare attackers step of the first combat phase in that turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.
2013/06/07: Spells cast from zones other than a player's hand and spells that were countered are counted by the storm ability.
2013/06/07: A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
2013/06/07: The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.
2013/06/07: You may choose new targets for any of the copies. You can choose differently for each copy.</Rulings>
