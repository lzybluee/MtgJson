<CardText>Etrata, the Silencer can't be blocked.
Whenever Etrata deals combat damage to a player, exile target creature that player controls and put a hit counter on that card. That player loses the game if they own three or more exiled cards with hit counters on them. Etrata's owner shuffles Etrata into their library.</CardText>

<Rulings>2018/10/05: If the player controls no creatures, Etrata's ability doesn't resolve. Etrata remains on the battlefield and its owner doesn't shuffle their library. The same is true if the target creature is an illegal target when Etrata's ability tries to resolve.
2018/10/05: If Etrata leaves the battlefield while its triggered ability is on the stack, it remains in its new zone and Etrata's owner shuffles their library.
2018/10/05: If Etrata's ability exiles a token creature, it won't count to determine whether three cards are exiled with hit counters.
2018/10/05: Etrata's owner shuffles it into their library as the triggered ability resolves, regardless of how many cards are in exile or whether the player loses the game.
2018/10/05: In a Commander game, if Etrata is your commander, you may put it into the command zone as its ability resolves. You'll still shuffle your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/01/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact or creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether it is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/01/24: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
2013/01/24: If the copied permanent is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2013/01/24: If the copied permanent is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
2013/01/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2013/01/24: If the token you create is a copy of a creature, you can exile <Stolen Identity> encoded on that token.
2013/04/15: If a creature with an encoded card deals combat damage to more than one player simultaneously (perhaps because some of the combat damage was redirected), the triggered ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to. Each ability will create a copy of the exiled card and allow you to cast it.
2013/04/15: If you want to encode the card with cipher onto a noncreature permanent such as a Keyrune that can turn into a creature, that permanent has to be a creature before the spell with cipher starts resolving. You can choose only a creature to encode the card onto.
2013/04/15: The copy of the card with cipher is created in and cast from exile.
2013/04/15: You cast the copy of the card with cipher during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type.
2013/04/15: If you choose not to cast the copy, or you can't cast it (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed. You won't get a chance to cast the copy at a later time.
2013/04/15: The exiled card with cipher grants a triggered ability to the creature it's encoded on. If that creature loses that ability and subsequently deals combat damage to a player, the triggered ability won't trigger. However, the exiled card will continue to be encoded on that creature.
2013/04/15: If another player gains control of the creature, that player will control the triggered ability. That player will create a copy of the encoded card and may cast it.
2013/04/15: The spell with cipher is encoded on the creature as part of that spell's resolution, just after the spell's other effects. That card goes directly from the stack to exile. It never goes to the graveyard.
2013/04/15: You choose the creature as the spell resolves. The cipher ability doesn't target that creature, although the spell with cipher may target that creature (or a different creature) because of its other abilities.
2013/04/15: If the spell with cipher doesn't resolve, none of its effects will happen, including cipher. The card will go to its owner's graveyard and won't be encoded on a creature.
2013/04/15: If the creature leaves the battlefield, the exiled card will no longer be encoded on any creature. It will stay exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: <Nivix Guildmage>'s second ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
2012/10/01: When the second ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/10/01: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2012/10/01: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Sphinx's Revelation does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/10/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you copy a spell that you cast by paying its overload cost, the copy will resolve as though its overload cost had been paid as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: <Turn> will cause the creature lose all other colors and creature types, but it will retain any other card types (such as artifact) it may have.
2013/04/15: <Turn> overwrites all previous effects that set the targeted creature's power or toughness to specific values. Effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after <Turn> resolves will overwrite this effect.
2013/04/15: <Turn> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this to stop a creature's "At the beginning of your upkeep" or "When this creature enters the battlefield" abilities from triggering.
2013/04/15: If the affected creature gains an ability after <Turn> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2013/04/15: Effects that modify the targeted creature's power or toughness, such as the effects of Phytoburst or Legion's Initiative, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/10/01: Trostani's first ability checks the creature's toughness as it resolves. If that creature has left the battlefield, use its toughness from when it was last on the battlefield. You can't lose life this way if that creature's toughness was less than 0.
2013/04/15: The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
2013/04/15: You can choose any creature token you control for populate. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers' Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
2013/04/15: If you choose to copy a creature token that's a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
2013/04/15: If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.
2013/04/15: The new token doesn't copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
2013/04/15: Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the new token will work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: The declare blockers step is the last chance to cast <Devouring Light> before creatures deal their combat damage. However, a creature remains an attacking or blocking creature during the combat damage step and end of combat step. <Devouring Light> may be cast targeting such a creature during those steps, after the creature has dealt combat damage.
2014/07/18: You can tap untapped attacking or blocking creatures you control to help cast <Devouring Light>. This doesn't remove those creatures from combat.
2018/10/05: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.
2018/10/05: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2018/10/05: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Worldsoul Colossus (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{W}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{W}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}.
2018/10/05: You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
2018/10/05: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2018/10/05: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2018/10/05: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.</Rulings>
