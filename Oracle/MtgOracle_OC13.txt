<Name>Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge</Name>
<Type>Legendary Creature — Vampire Wizard 1/3</Type>
<ManaCost>1UBR (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Flying
When Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge enters the battlefield, each player exiles the top X cards of their library, where X is the amount of mana spent to cast Jeleva.
Whenever Jeleva attacks, you may cast an instant or sorcery card exiled with it without paying its mana cost.</CardText>
<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/10/17: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. However, you can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2013/10/17: If Jeleva leaves the battlefield, the exiled cards will remain exiled indefinitely. If Jeleva enters the battlefield again, it won't be associated with the cards the "other" Jeleva exiled. The new Jeleva will exile a new set of cards. Only those cards can be cast using Jeleva's last ability.
2013/10/17: The card is cast before blocking creatures are declared.
2013/10/17: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
2013/10/17: If you cast an instant or sorcery card using Jeleva's last ability, you do so while that ability is resolving. If you choose not to (or you can't), you won't get a chance to cast it later unless the ability triggers again.
2013/10/17: When casting an instant or sorcery card this way, ignore all timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2014/02/01: The amount of mana you spent to cast this creature is usually equal to its converted mana cost. However, you also include any additional costs you pay, including the cost imposed for casting your commander from the command zone.
2014/02/01: You can't choose to pay extra mana to cast a creature spell unless something instructs you to.
2014/02/01: If Jeleva enters the battlefield without being cast, then no mana was spent to cast it. This means X will be 0, so no cards will be exiled.</Rulings>

• Put X +1/+1 counters on target creature. X can't be 0.

<Artist>Tyler Jacobson</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/10/17: You announce the value of X as you activate the ability, and all instances of X in the activation cost are equal to the announced value. For example, if you choose 2 as the value of X, then you pay {2} and remove two +1/+1 counters to pay the cost.
2014/02/01: The amount of mana you spent to cast this creature is usually equal to its converted mana cost. However, you also include any additional costs you pay, including the cost imposed for casting your commander from the command zone.
2014/02/01: You can't choose to pay extra mana to cast a creature spell unless something instructs you to.
2014/02/01: If Marath enters the battlefield without being cast, then no mana was spent to cast it. It will therefore enter the battlefield without any +1/+1 counters. If no other effects are increasing its toughness at that time, it will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.

<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/10/17: If Oloro is your commander, its last ability will trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step on your first turn.
2013/10/17: Oloro's second ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life is gained.
2013/10/17: You decide whether to pay {1} as the second ability resolves. If you do, you'll draw a card and each opponent will lose 1 life.
2013/10/17: Oloro's first ability works only if Oloro is on the battlefield.
2013/10/17: In some unusual cases, you can gain life even though your life total actually decreases. For example, if you are being attacked by two 3/3 creatures and you block one with a 2/2 creature with lifelink, your life total will decrease by 1 even though you've gained 2 life. Oloro's second ability would trigger.
2013/10/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.
2013/10/17: If two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Oloro's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
