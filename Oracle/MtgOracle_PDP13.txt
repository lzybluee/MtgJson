<Name>Bonescythe Sliver</Name>
<Type>Creature — Sliver 2/2</Type>
<ManaCost>3W (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Sliver creatures you control have double strike. (They deal both first-strike and regular combat damage.)</CardText>
<Flavor>"Their appendages are sharper than our swords and quicker than our bows."
—Hastric, Thunian scout</Flavor>
<Artist>Brad Rigney</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: If <Bonescythe Sliver> leaves the battlefield after other Sliver creatures you control have dealt first-strike damage but before regular combat damage, those Slivers won't deal regular combat damage (unless they still have double strike for some other reason).
2013/07/01: If you change the creature type of a Sliver you control so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures you control.
2013/07/01: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like flying, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.</Rulings>

<Name>Scavenging Ooze</Name>
<Type>Creature — Ooze 2/2</Type>
<ManaCost>1G (2)</ManaCost>
<CardText>{G}: Exile target card from a graveyard. If it was a creature card, put a +1/+1 counter on Scavenging Ooze and you gain 1 life.</CardText>
<Flavor>In nature, not a single bone or scrap of flesh goes to waste.</Flavor>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: If the target card is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. No +1/+1 counter will be put on <Scavenging Ooze> and you won't gain life. Notably, this means that if you activate <Scavenging Ooze>'s ability multiple times targeting the same creature card, only the first instance of the ability to resolve will have any effect.</Rulings>
