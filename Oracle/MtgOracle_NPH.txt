<CardText>+4: Target player exiles a card from their hand.

<Multiverseid>214350</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: A game that restarts immediately ends the preceding game. The players in that game then immediately begin a new game. No player wins, loses, or draws the original game as a result of Karn's ability.
2018/12/07: Players can't move cards between their deck and sideboard before the new game.
2018/12/07: The player who controlled the ability that restarted the game is the starting player in the new game. The new game starts like a game normally does: Each player shuffles their deck (except the cards left in exile by Karn's ability). Each player's life total becomes 20 (or the starting life total for whatever format you're playing). Players draw a hand of seven cards. Players may take mulligans. Players may take actions based on cards in their opening hands, such as those of Leylines.
2018/12/07: Karn's first and third abilities are linked. Similarly, Karn's second and third abilities are linked. Only non-Aura permanent cards exiled by either of Karn's first two abilities will remain in exile when the game restarts.
2018/12/07: After the pregame procedure is complete but before the new game's first turn, Karn's ability finishes resolving and the cards left in exile are put onto the battlefield. If this causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put onto the stack at the beginning of the first upkeep step.
2018/12/07: Permanents put onto the battlefield due to Karn's ability will have been under the starting controller's control continuously since the beginning of that player's first turn. Creatures among them can attack and their activated abilities with {T} in the cost can be activated.
2018/12/07: Any permanents put onto the battlefield with Karn's ability that entered the battlefield tapped will untap during their controller's first untap step.
2018/12/07: No actions taken in the game that was restarted apply to the new game. For example, if you were dealt damage by Stigma Lasher in the original game, the effect that states you can't gain life doesn't carry over to the new game.
2018/12/07: Players won't have any counters or emblems they had in the original game.
2018/12/07: In a multiplayer game, any player who left the game before it was restarted with Karn's ability won't be involved in the new game.
2018/12/07: If a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the permanents you control from Karn's ability are exiled.
2018/12/07: In a Commander game, each player puts their commander into the command zone before shuffling their deck, unless it was exiled with Karn. In that case, the commander remains in exile and will be put onto the battlefield when Karn's ability finishes resolving.
2018/12/07: The number of times a player has cast their commander from the command zone resets to zero. The amount of combat damage dealt to players by each commander is reset to 0.</Rulings>

2011/06/01: The instant or sorcery card you target with the enters-the-battlefield triggered ability is cast as part of the resolution of that ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," are not.
2011/06/01: If you are unable to cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, the card remains in its owner's graveyard.
2011/06/01: You may pay additional costs, such as kicker costs, of the instant or sorcery card.
2011/06/01: If the card has any mandatory additional costs, then you must pay them in order to cast the spell.
2016/06/08: A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have taken mulligans and "scryed" if applicable. If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand, the starting player takes all such actions first in any order, followed by each other player in turn order.

2011/06/01: Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.
2011/06/01: Except for also being an artifact, <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing more (unless that creature is itself copying something or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2011/06/01: If <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies a noncreature artifact, it is no longer a creature.

2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent is a token, <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, except it's also an artifact. <Phyrexian Metamorph> is not a token.
2011/06/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when <Phyrexian Metamorph> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this] enters the battlefield" or "[this] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2011/06/01: If <Phyrexian Metamorph> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent (due to Mass Polymorph or Liliana Vess's third ability, for example), <Phyrexian Metamorph> can't become a copy of that permanent.

<Rulings>2017/11/17: Swampwalk is a keyword ability that means "This creature can't be blocked if defending player controls a Swamp." Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Graven Cairns is neither a Swamp nor a Mountain, while Blood Crypt is both.
2017/11/17: If another triggered ability during your upkeep causes you to sacrifice a creature, such as that of Lord of the Pit, you won't be able to target it with Sheoldred's triggered ability as that ability is put on the stack.
2017/11/17: The opponent whose upkeep it is chooses a creature to sacrifice when Sheoldred's second triggered ability resolves.
2017/11/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability will trigger twice at the beginning of the opposing team's upkeep, once for each player on that team. Each player sacrifices only a creature they control.</Rulings>

2011/06/01: It's possible for a creature an opponent controls to gain infect after Melira enters the battlefield. For example, your opponent could cast Glistening Oil on a creature, and then Melira's ability and Glistening Oil's ability would be applied in timestamp order, with the most recent effect winning. The damage dealt to you by such a creature won't result in you losing life (because the creature has infect) or in you getting poison counters (because Melira stops them). Similarly, damage dealt to a creature you control by such a creature won't result in damage being marked on the creature or in -1/-1 counters. However, abilities that check whether damage was dealt (such as lifelink or Whispering Specter's triggered ability) will still see that damage.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>233048</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/06/01: If one of the targeted players is an illegal target when the activated ability tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total will change.
2011/06/01: When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if Player A has 5 life and Player B has 3 life before the exchange, Player A will lose 2 life and Player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2011/06/01: If a player can't gain life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a higher life total. If a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a lower life total. In either of these cases, neither player's life total will change.
2011/06/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, each player is considered to have the same life total as their team. If the two targeted players are on different teams, the teams will end up exchanging life totals. If the two targeted players are teammates, nothing will happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/06/01: You can activate <Spellskite>'s ability even if <Spellskite> wouldn't be a legal target for the spell or ability. However, the target of that spell or ability will remain unchanged.
2011/06/01: If changing one target of a spell or ability to <Spellskite> would make other targets of that spell or ability illegal, the targets remain unchanged.
2011/06/01: If the spell or ability has multiple instances of the word "target," you choose which target you're changing to <Spellskite> when <Spellskite>'s ability resolves.
2011/06/01: By activating <Spellskite>'s ability multiple times, you can change each target of a spell or ability with multiple instances of the word "target" to <Spellskite>, one at a time.
2011/06/01: The target of the spell or ability won't change unless <Spellskite> fulfills all the targeting criteria, even if multiple instances of the word "target" are used. For example, you can't change both targets of Arc Trail to <Spellskite>.
2011/06/01: If a spell or ability has multiple targets but doesn't use the word "target" multiple times, such as Fulgent Distraction, you can only successfully change one of the targets to <Spellskite>.
2011/06/01: If a spell or ability has a variable number of targets, you can't change the number of targets.
2011/06/01: If <Spellskite> leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves, the targets remain unchanged.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/06/01: <Torpor Orb> stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.
2011/06/01: The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, Amulet of Vigor says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor would not trigger. If a land (that isn't also a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor would trigger.
2011/06/01: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected.
2011/06/01: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with Clone, are unaffected.
2011/06/01: Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control March of the Machines, which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," <Torpor Orb> will be a creature when it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
2011/06/01: If <Torpor Orb> and a creature enter the battlefield at the same time, that creature entering the battlefield won't cause triggered abilities to trigger.</Rulings>
