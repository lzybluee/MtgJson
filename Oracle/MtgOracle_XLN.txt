<Rulings>2017/09/29: If one of the targeted players is an illegal target when the triggered ability of <Axis of Mortality> tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total will change.
2017/09/29: When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if player A has 5 life and player B has 3 life before the exchange, player A will lose 2 life and player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2017/09/29: If a player can't gain life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a higher life total. If a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a lower life total. In either of these cases, neither player's life total will change.
2017/09/29: In a Two-Headed Giant game, each player is considered to have the same life total as their team. If the two targeted players are on different teams, those players gain or lose the appropriate amount of life so that the teams end up exchanging life totals. If the two targeted players are teammates, they can't exchange life totals.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If no card is revealed, most likely because that player's library is empty, the exploring creature receives a +1/+1 counter.
2018/01/19: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to explore but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still explores. If you reveal a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything, but you may put the revealed card into your graveyard.

2017/09/29: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Ixalan's Binding> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2017/09/29: If <Ixalan's Binding> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
2017/09/29: If the exiled card is a land card that's become a nonland permanent, <Ixalan's Binding> won't stop players from playing lands with that name.
2017/09/29: If there is no exiled card (perhaps because the exiled permanent was a token or was a commander that moved to the command zone in the Commander variant), <Ixalan's Binding> won't stop players from casting spells.
2017/09/29: In a multiplayer game, if <Ixalan's Binding>'s owner leaves the game and another player owns the exiled card, the exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2017/09/29: If the exiled card has a different name in exile than it did on the battlefield, <Ixalan's Binding> stops players from casting spells with the name of that card as it exists in exile.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: You don't choose whether to reveal a Dinosaur card from your hand until the triggered ability of <Priest of the Wakening Sun> resolves. You may respond to the triggered ability by taking an action to get a Dinosaur card into your hand, such as activating its second ability.
2017/09/29: While resolving <Priest of the Wakening Sun>'s triggered ability, you can't reveal multiple Dinosaur cards to gain more life.
2017/09/29: You can reveal the same Dinosaur card for multiple Priests of the Wakening Sun or for the same one over multiple turns.
2018/01/19: If an effect refers to a "[subtype] spell" or "[subtype] card," it refers only to a spell or card that has that subtype. For example, March of the Drowned is a card that benefits Pirates and features Pirates in its illustration, but it isn't a Pirate card.</Rulings>

2018/01/19: If no card is revealed, most likely because that player's library is empty, the exploring creature receives a +1/+1 counter.
2018/01/19: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to explore but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still explores. If you reveal a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything, but you may put the revealed card into your graveyard.

<Artist>Sara Winters</Artist>
<Multiverseid>435194</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/09/29: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're usually written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
2017/09/29: Replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are replacement effects.
2017/09/29: <Tocatli Honor Guard>'s ability stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield. This includes abilities that would trigger when <Tocatli Honor Guard> itself enters the battlefield.
2017/09/29: The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, Contraband Kingpin has an ability that says "Whenever an artifact enters the battlefield under your control, scry 1." If an artifact creature enters the battlefield under your control, that ability won't trigger. If a noncreature artifact enters the battlefield under your control, the ability will trigger.
2017/09/29: Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control March of the Machines, which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," each artifact will be a creature at the time it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
2017/09/29: If <Tocatli Honor Guard> and another creature enter the battlefield at the same time, neither creature entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>435212</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/09/29: The delayed triggered ability created by Jace's first ability can trigger more than once in a turn if creatures you control deal combat damage at different times in a turn (most likely because one or more has first strike) or if creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at once.
2017/09/29: If a token created by Jace's second ability becomes the target of a spell, its ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of that spell. The ability will resolve first (causing the token to be sacrificed). Unless the spell has another target, it will then be countered when it tries to resolve for having no legal targets.
2017/09/29: The tokens from Jace's last ability copy exactly what is printed on Jace and nothing else. They don't copy how many counters are on him or Auras attached to him, or any non-copy effects that have changed his color or types, and so on. They'll each enter the battlefield with three loyalty counters. You can activate one loyalty ability of each of the tokens this turn.
2017/09/29: The tokens created by Jace's last ability don't have the legendary supertype. If another object becomes a copy of the token, that copy also won't be legendary.
2017/09/29: You can control one legendary <Jace, Cunning Castaway> in addition to any number of nonlegendary copies of <Jace, Cunning Castaway>.</Rulings>

2017/09/29: If a card in your graveyard has more than one of these types (such as a Dinosaur that's a Vampire Dinosaur due to Arcane Adaptation's effect), you may choose to return it for one of its types and return another card of the other type.
2017/09/29: If you don't have a card in your graveyard of one of the listed creature types, you just continue to the next listed type.
2018/01/19: If an effect refers to a "[subtype] spell" or "[subtype] card," it refers only to a spell or card that has that subtype. For example, March of the Drowned is a card that benefits Pirates and features Pirates in its illustration, but it isn't a Pirate card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/09/29: If <Kitesail Freebooter> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the opponent will reveal their hand, but no card will be exiled.

2017/09/29: In a multiplayer game, if <Kitesail Freebooter>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to its owner's hand. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

When Brazen Buccaneers enters the battlefield, it explores. (Reveal the top card of your library. Put that card into your hand if it's a land. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature, then put the card back or put it into your graveyard.)</CardText>
<Artist>Joseph Meehan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>435288</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/01/19: Once an ability that causes a creature to explore begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the exploring creature after you reveal a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
2018/01/19: If no card is revealed, most likely because that player's library is empty, the exploring creature receives a +1/+1 counter.
2018/01/19: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to explore but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still explores. If you reveal a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything, but you may put the revealed card into your graveyard. Effects that trigger "whenever a creature you control explores" trigger if appropriate.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/01/19: Raid abilities care only that you attacked with a creature. It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked with, or which opponent or planeswalker controlled by an opponent those creatures attacked.
2018/01/19: Raid abilities evaluate the entire turn to see if you attacked with a creature. That creature doesn't have to still be on the battlefield. Similarly, the player or planeswalker it attacked doesn't have to still be in the game or on the battlefield, respectively.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/09/29: If your life total is brought to 0 or less at the same time that <Sun-Crowned Hunters> is dealt damage, you lose the game before its enrage ability resolves.
2018/01/19: If multiple sources deal damage to a creature with an enrage ability at the same time, most likely because multiple creatures blocked that creature, the enrage ability triggers only once.
2018/01/19: If lethal damage is dealt to a creature with an enrage ability, that ability triggers. The creature with that enrage ability leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, so it won't be affected by the resolving ability.</Rulings>

<Artist>Christine Choi</Artist>
<Multiverseid>435319</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/09/29: Casting <Sunbird's Invocation> won't cause its own ability to trigger.
2017/09/29: The ability of <Sunbird's Invocation> resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve even if that spell is countered. If you cast a spell as part of the resolution of the ability, that spell resolves before the spell that caused the ability to trigger.
2017/09/29: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost.
2017/09/29: If the spell's converted mana cost is 0, you do nothing as the ability of <Sunbird's Invocation> resolves.
2017/09/29: If a revealed card in your library has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/09/29: If you cast one of the revealed cards, you do so as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.
2017/09/29: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Costly Plunder, those must be paid to cast the card.
2017/09/29: The converted mana cost of a split card, such as cards with aftermath from the Amonkhet block, is based on the combined mana cost of its two halves. The converted mana cost of the resulting spell is based only on the half you cast.</Rulings>

2017/09/29: <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> copies the printed values of the target creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2017/09/29: Notably, <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> won't copy effects that make a noncreature permanent become a creature. If this causes <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> to stop being a creature, it's removed from combat.
2017/09/29: If <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> copies a creature that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
2017/09/29: If an effect from a resolving spell or ability, such as that of Rallying Roar, begins to apply to <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> before it becomes a copy of another creature, that effect will continue to apply.
2017/09/29: Because attackers have already been declared, any abilities <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> copies that trigger when it or other creatures attack won't trigger.
2017/09/29: Once the ability of <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> resolves, its new characteristics don't change if the characteristics of the copied creature change or if the copied creature leaves the battlefield.
2017/09/29: <Tilonalli's Skinshifter> remains a copy of the creature through the end step. Damage is removed from it at the same time that it stops being a copy.</Rulings>

2017/09/29: If a creature isn't able to attack you or a planeswalker you control for any reason (such as being tapped as its controller's declare attackers step begins or being affected by "summoning sickness"), that creature doesn't have to attack. If no creatures a player controls are able to attack you or a planeswalker you control, <Trove of Temptation>'s requirement has no effect during that combat.

2017/09/29: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2017/09/29: If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield. You can't cast it.
2017/09/29: Once you begin to cast the exiled card, it's considered a new object. You'll control that spell and the permanent that spell becomes even if <Hostage Taker> leaves the battlefield.
2017/09/29: If it's still in exile, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Hostage Taker> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2017/09/29: In a multiplayer game, if <Hostage Taker>'s owner leaves the game while the card is still exiled and another player owns that card, the exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

<Artist>Emrah Elmasli</Artist>

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Unlike the other double-faced cards in the Ixalan set, <Conqueror's Galleon> is exiled and then returned to battlefield transformed. It will be considered a new object entering the battlefield. Notably, it will return to the battlefield untapped.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: <Conqueror's Galleon> won't be exiled if it doesn't survive combat.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Unlike the other double-faced cards in the Ixalan set, Conqueror's Galleon is exiled and then returned to battlefield transformed. It will be considered a new object entering the battlefield. Notably, it will return to the battlefield untapped.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: Conqueror's Galleon won't be exiled if it doesn't survive combat.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.

<Multiverseid>435401</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/09/29: Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of a spell can't reduce that spell's colored mana requirements.
2017/09/29: <Primal Amulet>'s last ability triggers once you've completed casting a spell. Notably, you can't use Primal Wellspring to pay for the spell that gives <Primal Amulet> its fourth counter.
2017/09/29: If a fourth charge counter is put on <Primal Amulet> by something other than the resolution of its ability (as modified by any applicable replacement effects), you won't be able to remove those counters and transform it yet. You'll have to wait until you cast an instant or sorcery spell again.
2017/09/29: The mana produced by Primal Wellspring can be spent on anything, not just an instant or sorcery spell.
2017/09/29: Any instant or sorcery spell you spend the mana on will be copied, not just one that requires targets.
2017/09/29: The delayed triggered ability from Primal Wellspring's mana ability will trigger even if Primal Wellspring leaves the battlefield before that mana is spent.
2017/09/29: If more than one mana produced by a Primal Wellspring is spent to cast a single instant or sorcery spell, the delayed triggered ability associated with each mana spent will trigger. That many copies will be created. It doesn't matter if this mana was produced by one Primal Wellspring or by multiple Primal Wellsprings.
2017/09/29: Primal Wellspring's delayed triggered ability can copy the spell even if that spell is countered before the ability resolves.
2017/09/29: If a copy is created, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2017/09/29: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/09/29: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2017/09/29: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2017/09/29: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2017/09/29: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Noncreature permanents such as <Shadowed Caravel> can have +1/+1 counters put on them. Those counters remain on it while it's not a creature, and will apply if it becomes a creature.
2017/09/29: If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to explore but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still explores. Effects that trigger when a creature you control explores, such as that of <Shadowed Caravel>, trigger if appropriate.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.

2017/09/29: You can't choose the name of a token unless that token has the same name as a card.
2017/09/29: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip and crew) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by the last ability of <Sorcerous Spyglass>.
2017/09/29: An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.
2017/09/29: <Sorcerous Spyglass> affects cards regardless of what zone they're in. This includes cards in hand, cards in the graveyard, and exiled cards.</Rulings>
