Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may exile target nonland permanent other than Admonition Angel.

<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Multiverseid>197160</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2010/03/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.
2010/03/01: <Admonition Angel>'s landfall ability and its last ability are linked. The last ability refers only to cards exiled with its landfall ability.
2010/03/01: If <Admonition Angel>'s landfall ability triggers, but the Angel leaves the battlefield before it resolves, its last ability will trigger and resolve first. All previously exiled cards will be returned to the battlefield. Then the landfall ability will resolve and exile the targeted permanent forever.</Rulings>

Enchanted land is a 2/6 white Wall creature with defender. It's still a land.
When enchanted land dies, return that card to its owner's hand.</CardText>
<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>197872</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

Prevent the next 3 damage that a source of your choice would deal to you and/or permanents you control this turn. If damage is prevented this way, Refraction Trap deals that much damage to any target.</CardText>
<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>189163</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: <Refraction Trap>'s only target is the permanent or player it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you cast <Refraction Trap>, not at the time it prevents damage.
2010/03/01: <Refraction Trap> doesn't target the source of the damage it prevents. You choose that source as <Refraction Trap> resolves. If you cast <Refraction Trap> for {W}, the source you choose doesn't have to be the red instant or sorcery spell an opponent cast.
2010/03/01: If the targeted permanent or player is an illegal target by the time <Refraction Trap> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. No damage will be prevented.
2010/03/01: <Refraction Trap> can prevent damage that would be dealt to you, one or more creatures you control, and/or one or more planeswalkers you control.
2010/03/01: If the chosen source would simultaneously deal damage to multiple permanents you control, or would simultaneously deal damage to you and at least one permanent you control, you choose which of that damage to prevent. For example, if the chosen source is Earthquake, you might choose to prevent the next 2 damage it would deal to you and the next 1 damage it would deal to a creature you control. You don't decide until the point at which the source would deal its damage.
2010/03/01: <Refraction Trap>'s effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, <Refraction Trap> (not the chosen source) deals damage to the targeted permanent or player as part of that prevention effect. <Refraction Trap> is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
2010/03/01: If the chosen source would deal damage, <Refraction Trap> prevents 3 of that source's damage and the source deals its excess damage (if any) at the same time. Immediately afterward, as part of that same prevention effect, <Refraction Trap> deals its damage. This happens before state-based actions are checked, and before the spell or ability that caused damage to be dealt resumes its resolution.
2010/03/01: Whether the targeted permanent or player is still a legal target is no longer checked after <Refraction Trap> resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by <Refraction Trap> gains shroud after <Refraction Trap> resolves but before it prevents damage, <Refraction Trap> will still prevent damage and still deal damage to that creature. If <Refraction Trap> can't deal damage to the targeted permanent or player (because the creature is no longer on the battlefield, or is no longer a creature, or the player is no longer in the game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won't deal any damage itself.
2010/03/01: If <Refraction Trap> doesn't prevent any damage (perhaps because a different prevention effect is applied to the damage the source would deal, or because the damage is unpreventable), <Refraction Trap> won't deal any damage itself.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: Once the spell resolves, having a land enter the battlefield under your control provides no further benefit.

<Rulings>2010/03/01: As <Ruin Ghost>'s ability resolves, the targeted land is exiled, then immediately returned to the battlefield.

Any spells or abilities that were targeting the old land don't target the new one. Whether the old land was tapped or untapped has no bearing on the new one.
2010/03/01: The returned land behaves like any other land that's put onto the battlefield. If it has an ability that says it enters the battlefield tapped, it does so. (Otherwise it enters the battlefield untapped.) If it has an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, that ability triggers.
2010/03/01: The land returns under your control, regardless of who owns it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: <Jwari Shapeshifter> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.

2010/03/01: If the chosen creature is a token, your <Jwari Shapeshifter> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Your <Jwari Shapeshifter> is not a token.

For example, you can't play the card during your combat phase unless it has flash. Similarly, if the exiled card is an artifact land, you can't play it if you've already played a land that turn. If it's a nonland card, you'll have to pay its mana cost. The only thing that's different is you're playing it from the exile zone.

<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: Other circumstances can still cause an opponent to lose the game, however.

2017/11/17: <Abyssal Persecutor> won't preclude an opponent's life total from reaching 0 or less. It will just preclude that player from losing the game as a result.

2017/11/17: Even though your opponents can't lose the game, a player can't pay an amount of life that's greater than their life total. If a player's life total is 0 or less, that player can't pay life at all, with one exception: a player may always pay 0 life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: <Brink of Disaster> may target and may enchant a permanent that's already tapped. It won't do anything until the enchanted permanent changes from being untapped to being tapped.
2010/03/01: When the enchanted permanent becomes tapped, <Brink of Disaster>'s ability triggers. That permanent will be destroyed when the ability resolves, even if <Brink of Disaster> has left the battlefield or is somehow enchanting a different permanent by then.
2010/03/01: If the enchanted permanent is tapped as a cost to activate a mana ability, the mana ability resolves immediately, then <Brink of Disaster>'s ability goes on the stack.
2010/03/01: If the enchanted permanent is tapped as a cost to activate an ability that's not a mana ability, <Brink of Disaster>'s ability will go on the stack on top of that activated ability. <Brink of Disaster>'s ability resolves first (destroying that permanent), then the permanent's activated ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: When the triggered ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creature they will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
2010/03/01: If multiple creatures you control (possibly including <Butcher of Malakir> itself) are put into their owners' graveyards at the same time, <Butcher of Malakir>'s triggered ability will trigger that many times.
2010/03/01: If you control more than one <Butcher of Malakir> and a creature you control is put into a graveyard, each of those Butchers' abilities will trigger. Each opponent will sacrifice a creature each time one of those abilities resolves.
2010/03/01: If you and an opponent each control a <Butcher of Malakir> and a creature is put into a graveyard, a chain reaction happens. First the ability of one player's Butcher will trigger, causing each opponent to sacrifice a creature. That sacrifice causes the ability of the other player's Butcher to trigger, and so on.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>197874</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>197836</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: If you cast <Nemesis Trap> for {B}{B}, you may still target any attacking creature, not just the white attacking creature.
2010/03/01: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2010/03/01: If you cast <Nemesis Trap> during your opponent's declare attackers step, you'll put the token onto the battlefield before the declare blockers step begins and you can block with it this combat. If you cast <Nemesis Trap> later in the combat phase a, you won't be able to block with the token.
2010/03/01: The token you put onto the battlefield copies exactly what was printed on the exiled creature and nothing more (unless it was copying something else or it was a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether the exiled creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. For example, if <Nemesis Trap> targets an animated Celestial Colonnade, the token you put onto the battlefield will be a Celestial Colonnade that's just a land. (Because of this, <Nemesis Trap> has received minor errata to specify that you put a token, not a "creature token," onto the battlefield.)
2010/03/01: If the exiled creature was copying something else (for example, if it was a Jwari Shapeshifter), then your token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever the exiled creature was copying.
2010/03/01: If the exiled creature was a token, your token copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2010/03/01: If the exiled creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2010/03/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the exiled creature will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2010/03/01: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Nemesis Trap> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve. You won't get a token.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jung Park</Artist>
<Multiverseid>197766</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The number of targets you choose for <Comet Storm> is one more than the number of times it's kicked. First you declare how many times you're going to kick the spell (at the same time you declare the value of X), then you choose the targets accordingly, then you pay the costs. No player can respond between the time you declare how many times you'll kick the spell and the time you choose the targets.
2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want <Comet Storm> to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.
2010/03/01: As long as any of its targets are legal at the time <Comet Storm> resolves, <Comet Storm> will deal X damage to each of those legal targets.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant land
Enchanted land is a 4/2 red Beast creature with trample. It's still a land.
When enchanted land dies, return that card to its owner's hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>180416</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: If you're the defending player, Kazuul's ability triggers once for each creature that attacks, not just once per combat. The attacking player chooses whether to pay {3} or let you have an Ogre token each time one of those abilities resolves.
2010/03/01: As the ability resolves, you can't put the Ogre token onto the battlefield without explicitly giving the attacking player the option to pay {3}, even if the attacking player has forgotten about this ability.
2010/03/01: The ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step. If you put an Ogre token onto the battlefield as a result, you may block with it during that combat phase.
2010/03/01: If an attacking creature has a "Whenever this creature attacks" ability, that ability is put on the stack first, then Kazuul's ability is put on the stack. Although Kazuul's ability will resolve first, and potentially create an Ogre token, any target of the other ability will already have been chosen at this point, and thus could not have been the new Ogre token.
2010/03/01: In a multiplayer game, the ability checks whether you're the defending player for each individual attacking creature. For example, if one creature attacks you and two creatures attack another player, Kazuul's ability triggers just once.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Ricochet Trap> resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets to choose from, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal itself.
2010/03/01: If you cast <Ricochet Trap> targeting a spell that targets a spell on the stack (like Cancel does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself. You can, however, change that spell's target to <Ricochet Trap>. If you do, that spell won't resolve when it tries to resolve because <Ricochet Trap> will have left the stack by then.

<Rulings>2010/03/01: This Trap doesn't work the same way as other Traps. Rather than having an optional alternative cost, <Stone Idol Trap> has a mandatory cost-reduction ability.
2010/03/01: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2010/03/01: If you cast <Stone Idol Trap> during your opponent's declare attackers step, the Construct token you put onto the battlefield will be able to block that turn.

If you like, you may cast <Stone Idol Trap> during your own combat phase, in which case it will count your attacking creatures.

<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Explore>'s effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands.

<Rulings>2010/03/01: You must choose two targets as you cast <Feral Contest>: a creature you control and any other creature. If you can't (because there's only one creature on the battlefield, perhaps), then you can't cast the spell. Note that the second target may also be a creature you control.
2010/03/01: If just the first targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Feral Contest> resolves, it won't get a +1/+1 counter. However, the second targeted creature is still affected by the blocking restriction the spell imposes, so it'll have to block the first targeted creature that turn if able.
2010/03/01: If just the second targeted creature is an illegal target by the time <Feral Contest> resolves, the first targeted creature will get a +1/+1 counter, but the second targeted creature won't have to block it that turn.
2010/03/01: Casting <Feral Contest> doesn't force you to attack with the first targeted creature that turn. If that creature doesn't attack, the second targeted creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2010/03/01: If you attack with the first targeted creature but the second targeted creature isn't able to block it (for example, because the first targeted creature has flying and the second one doesn't), the requirement to block does nothing. The second targeted creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2010/03/01: Tapped creatures, creatures that can't block as the result of an effect, creatures with unpaid costs to block (such as those from War Cadence), and creatures that aren't controlled by the defending player are exempt from effects that would require them to block. Such creatures can be targeted by <Feral Contest>, but the requirement to block does nothing.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: During another player's untap step, effects that would otherwise cause your creatures to stay tapped don't apply because they apply only during *your* untap step. For example, if you control a <Quest for Renewal> with four or more quest counters on it and a Deep-Slumber Titan (a creature that says "Deep-Slumber Titan doesn't untap during your untap step"), you untap Deep-Slumber Titan during each other player's untap step.

This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.

<Rulings>2010/03/01: If you want to cast the targeted card, you cast it as part of the resolution of Wrexial's triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only during your end step").
2010/03/01: If you are unable to cast the targeted card (there are no legal targets for the spell, for example), nothing happens when the ability resolves, and the card remains in its owner's graveyard.
2010/03/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. On the other hand, if the card has additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those.
2010/03/01: If you cast the targeted card and it would be put into its owner's graveyard from the stack for any reason (either because it resolves or because it's countered), that card is exiled instead.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: If you control more than one <Amulet of Vigor>, each Amulet's ability triggers when a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control. The first ability that resolves will untap that permanent. If the permanent somehow becomes tapped again before the next ability resolves, the next ability will untap it as well (and so on).
2010/03/01: For <Amulet of Vigor>'s ability to trigger, a permanent must enter the battlefield tapped due to an effect that says "put [the permanent] onto the battlefield tapped," "[this permanent] enters the battlefield tapped," or the like. If it enters the battlefield untapped, the ability won't trigger, even if you tap that permanent afterward.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: The source of the damage is <Razor Boomerang>, not the equipped creature. However, the equipped creature's ability is what targets the permanent or player. If <Razor Boomerang> is equipped to a red creature, for example, the ability couldn't target a creature with protection from red. It could target a creature with protection from artifacts, but all the damage would be prevented.
2010/03/01: Unattaching <Razor Boomerang> is a cost to activate the equipped creature's ability.
2010/03/01: If <Razor Boomerang> is no longer on the battlefield by time the equipped creature's ability resolves, it's not returned to its owner's hand. The rest of the ability resolves as normal, so <Razor Boomerang> will still deal damage to the targeted creature.
2010/03/01: If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time the equipped creature's ability resolves, the entire ability doesn't resolve. <Razor Boomerang> remains on the battlefield unattached.</Rulings>
