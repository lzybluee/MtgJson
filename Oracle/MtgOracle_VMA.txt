<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>382853</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/05/29: None of the affected permanents are targeted. Players may vote for a permanent with protection from white, for example.
2014/05/29: Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
2014/05/29: You must vote for one of the available options. You can't abstain.
2014/05/29: No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
2014/05/29: Players can't do anything after they finishing voting but before the spell or ability that included the vote finishes resolving.
2014/05/29: The phrase "the vote is tied" refers only to when there is more than one choice that received the most votes. For example, if a 5-player vote from among three different choices ends 3 votes to 1 vote to 1 vote, the vote isn't tied.
2017/06/13: If a choice has no votes, it can't have the most votes. If all choices have zero votes, the voting ability has no effect.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>383016</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You still put the top creature card from your graveyard onto the battlefield even if this card is not in your graveyard when the triggered ability resolves.
2008/04/01: The "top" card of your graveyard is the card that was put there most recently.
2008/04/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards. This is a little-known rule because new cards that care about graveyard order haven't been printed in years.
2008/04/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/04/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. —Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/04/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.
2008/04/01: If you control <Mistmoon Griffin> when it goes to the graveyard, you exile the Griffin and return the top creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It doesn't matter whose graveyard the Griffin goes to.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2017/04/18: Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
2017/04/18: Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
2017/04/18: You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.
2018/01/19: There are many important moments in the story, but the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. These cards have the Planeswalker symbol in their text box; this symbol has no effect on gameplay.

<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>
<Artist>Anthony Jones</Artist>
<Multiverseid>382843</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If a spell is both blue and red, you pay {1} less, not {2} less.
2004/10/04: The generic X cost is still considered generic even if there is a requirement that a specific color be used for it. For example, "only black mana can be spent this way". This distinction is important for effects which reduce the generic portion of a spell's cost.
2004/10/04: This can lower the cost to zero, but not below zero.
2004/10/04: The effect is cumulative.
2004/10/04: The lower cost is not optional like with some other cost reducers.
2004/10/04: Can never affect the colored part of the cost.
2004/10/04: If this card is sacrificed to pay part of a spell's cost, the cost reduction still applies.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/05/29: <Scourge of the Throne>'s ability has an intervening "if" clause.

If, at either time, the player isn't the one with the most life or tied for the most life, the ability will have no effect. Notably, this is different than how dethrone works. (Dethrone checks only once to see if the ability triggers.)
2014/05/29: Dethrone doesn't trigger if the creature attacks a planeswalker, even if its controller has the most life.
2014/05/29: Once dethrone triggers, it doesn't matter what happens to the players' life totals before the ability resolves. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature even if the defending player doesn't have the most life as the ability resolves.
2014/05/29: The +1/+1 counter is put on the creature before blockers are declared.
2014/05/29: In a Two-Headed Giant game, dethrone will trigger if the creature attacks either player on the team with the most life or tied for the most life.</Rulings>

If this happens, then the "leaves the battlefield" trigger will have nothing to return. Then its "enters the battlefield" trigger resolves, and all other permanents you control are exiled forever.
2016/06/08: If an Aura is exiled with <Worldgorger Dragon>, the player who controls the Aura when it enters the battlefield chooses what it will enchant. It doesn't have to go back to the same place. It can't enter the battlefield enchanting a permanent that enters the battlefield at the same time.
2016/06/08: If Animate Dead is put onto the battlefield enchanting <Worldgorger Dragon>, <Worldgorger Dragon>'s enters-the-battlefield trigger will exile Animate Dead, which causes you to sacrifice <Worldgorger Dragon>, which causes Animate Dead to return to the battlefield attached to a creature card in a graveyard of your choice. If you can choose a creature card other than <Worldgorger Dragon>, you must do so after as many iterations of this loop as you'd like. If you can't choose a different card, and no player chooses to break the loop, the game ends in a draw.</Rulings>

2016/06/08: Any cards drawn prior to <Sylvan Library>'s ability resolving, including in your upkeep or in response to <Sylvan Library>'s triggered ability, can be chosen to be put back using this effect. <Sylvan Library>'s controller is responsible for keeping these cards distinguishable in hand, such as by keeping them separate from cards that began the turn in hand.

<Multiverseid>382904</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/05/29: Haste and dethrone are part of the copiable values of <Dack's Duplicate>. If another creature enters the battlefield as or becomes a copy of <Dack's Duplicate>, it will copy whatever <Dack's Duplicate> is copying and have haste and dethrone.
2014/05/29: The ability of <Dack's Duplicate> doesn't target the creature.
2014/05/29: <Dack's Duplicate> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), except it will have haste and dethrone. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2014/05/29: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Grenzo, Dungeon Warden), X is considered to be 0.
2014/05/29: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Dack's Duplicate>), then <Dack's Duplicate> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying. It will have haste and dethrone.
2014/05/29: If the chosen creature is a token, <Dack's Duplicate> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Dack's Duplicate> is not a token, even when copying one.
2014/05/29: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Dack's Duplicate> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2014/05/29: If <Dack's Duplicate> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Dack's Duplicate> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2014/05/29: You can choose to not copy anything. In that case, <Dack's Duplicate> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and will probably die almost immediately, when state-based actions are next performed.
2014/05/29: Dethrone doesn't trigger if the creature attacks a planeswalker, even if its controller has the most life.
2014/05/29: Once dethrone triggers, it doesn't matter what happens to the players' life totals before the ability resolves. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature even if the defending player doesn't have the most life as the ability resolves.
2014/05/29: The +1/+1 counter is put on the creature before blockers are declared.
2014/05/29: In a Two-Headed Giant game, dethrone will trigger if the creature attacks either player on the team with the most life or tied for the most life.</Rulings>
