<CardText>When you encounter Morphic Tide, each player shuffles all permanents they own into their library, then reveals that many cards from the top of their library. Each player puts all artifact, creature, land, and planeswalker cards revealed this way onto the battlefield, then does the same for enchantment cards, then puts all cards revealed this way that weren't put onto the battlefield on the bottom of their library in any order. (Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)</CardText>

<Multiverseid>423584</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/06/01: This ability is very similar to that of Warp World, but note that planeswalkers are put onto the battlefield.
2012/06/01: Taking it slowly, here's what happens when <Morphic Tide>'s ability resolves: 1) Each player counts the number of permanents they own. 2) Each player shuffles those permanents into their library. 3) Each player reveals cards from the top of their library equal to the number that player counted. 4) Each player puts all artifact, creature, land, and planeswalker cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. All of these cards enter the battlefield at the same time. 5) Each player puts all enchantment cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way can enchant an artifact, creature, land, or planeswalker that was already put onto the battlefield, but can't enchant an enchantment that's being put onto the battlefield at the same time as it. If multiple players have Auras to put onto the battlefield, the player whose turn it is announces what their Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all enchantments (both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time. 6) Each player puts all of their other revealed cards (instants, sorceries, and Auras that can't enchant anything) on the bottom of their library in any order.
2012/06/01: Cards such as Sakashima's Student that can enter the battlefield as a copy of another permanent won't be able to enter the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's entering the battlefield at the same time.
2012/06/01: After all permanents are put onto the battlefield and you planeswalk away from <Morphic Tide>, any abilities that triggered from those permanents entering the battlefield, from the previous generation of permanents leaving the battlefield, and from the new plane or phenomenon will be put onto the stack. You'll put all of your triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
2012/06/01: The permanents will enter the battlefield while <Morphic Tide> is face up. This means the game won't be on any plane when determining if any abilities trigger because those permanents entered the battlefield, for example. However, you'll planeswalk away from <Morphic Tide> before any such abilities are put on the stack. After you turn the next card of the planar deck face up, any abilities that triggered during the resolution of <Morphic Tide> (including any abilities that triggered because you encountered another phenomenon or planeswalked to the next plane) will be put on the stack. The planar controller will put their abilities on the stack in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. The last ability put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2012/06/01: Token permanents a player owns will count toward the number of cards that player reveals. They'll be shuffled into that player's library and subsequently cease to exist. A token's owner is the player under whose control it first entered the battlefield.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game.

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: <Academy at Tolaria West>'s first ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you have no cards in hand as your end step begins, and (2) the ability will do nothing unless you have no cards in hand by the time it resolves.
2009/10/01: If you discard your hand as a result of rolling {CHAOS}, <Academy at Tolaria West>'s first ability will then trigger at the beginning of your end step (unless you planeswalk or somehow put a card in your hand before then).</Rulings>

2009/10/01: <Agyrem>'s first and second abilities each set up a delayed triggered ability. These abilities will trigger at the beginning of the next end step even if <Agyrem> is no longer the face-up plane card.
2009/10/01: <Agyrem>'s first ability will return a card to the battlefield only if it's still in the graveyard by the time the delayed triggered ability resolves.

2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. Note that if a creature has multiple instances of exalted, each one triggers separately. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
2009/10/01: If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
2009/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until the turn ends. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
2009/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.

2009/10/01: For two players to exchange life totals, what actually happens is that each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if Player A has 5 life and Player B has 3 life before the exchange, Player A will lose 2 life and Player B will gain 2 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.

However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.

If a card is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, its color is checked in the graveyard, not as it last existed on the battlefield.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is.

The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: If a spell targets multiple things, it won't cause <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability to trigger, even if all but one of those targets has become illegal.
2009/10/01: If a spell targets the same player or object multiple times, it won't cause <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability to trigger.
2009/10/01: Other than choices involving modes or additional costs, the copies are created based on what they could target if the spell were cast anew. For example, if a player casts Naturalize ("Destroy target artifact or enchantment") targeting an artifact, <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability will copy it for each artifact and enchantment it could target (and each copy will target a different one of those), not just for each artifact it could target.
2009/10/01: Anything that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability.
2009/10/01: The controller of the spell that caused <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability to trigger also controls all the copies. That player chooses the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and resolves last.
2009/10/01: The copies that <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Glimmervoid Basin>'s first ability itself) won't trigger.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one â€”" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. Its controller can't choose a different one.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2009/10/01: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2009/10/01: As a token is created by the chaos ability, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: Despite the appearance of the reminder text, the unearth abilities that <Grixis> grants are activated abilities of each individual blue, black, and/or red creature card in a graveyard. They're not activated abilities of <Grixis>.
2009/10/01: A card's mana cost includes its color.
2009/10/01: <Grixis> may cause a creature card in a graveyard to have multiple unearth abilities. Its owner may activate any one of those abilities.
2009/10/01: If you activate a creature card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2009/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Essence Scatter) will not.
2009/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature if it would eventually leave the battlefield.
2009/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the exile abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2009/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead â€” unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.
2009/10/01: Unlike the unearth ability, the chaos ability returns a creature card from a graveyard to the battlefield indefinitely.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: Creatures may have negative power. For example, a 3/4 creature that gets -5/-0 becomes -2/4. The total of its power and toughness is 2. It would need +3/+0 to raise its power to 1.
2009/10/01: A creature that would assign 0 or less combat damage (due to having power 0 or less) doesn't assign combat damage at all.
2009/10/01: You may target any creature with <The Hippodrome>'s chaos ability. Whether its power is 0 or less isn't checked until the ability resolves.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If a creature controlled by a player other than the planar controller enters the battlefield, the planar controller (not the creature's controller) controls <Immersturm>'s triggered ability. That means that if multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, that player controls all of <Immersturm>'s triggered abilities and may put them on the stack in whichever order they like. The last one put on the stack is the first one to resolve.
2009/10/01: When the chaos ability resolves, the targeted creature is exiled, then immediately returned to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence.
2009/10/01: Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" choices for the card returned by the chaos ability are made by that card's owner, not its old controller or the controller of the chaos ability.

Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: As a token is created by <Isle of Vesuva>'s first ability, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: The chaos ability will destroy all creatures with the same name as the target creature, not just tokens created by <Isle of Vesuva>'s first ability. It doesn't matter who controls them.
2009/10/01: If the permanent targeted by the chaos ability has become an illegal target by the time the ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve. Nothing will be destroyed.
2009/10/01: A token's name is the same as the creature types listed by the effect that created it, unless the token copies a permanent or that effect specifically gives that token a name. For example, the effect of The Fourth Sphere's chaos ability creates a token with the name "Zombie."
2009/10/01: A face-down creature has no name, so it doesn't have the same name as anything else.
2009/10/01: If the creature that caused <Isle of Vesuva>'s first ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, the ability still creates a token. It will have the copiable values of the characteristics of that nontoken creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If the permanent targeted by the chaos ability isn't destroyed (because it regenerates, or because it has indestructible), all other permanents with the same name as it will still be destroyed.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: The effect of <Izzet Steam Maze>'s first ability is mandatory. You must copy the spell whether you want to or not.
2009/10/01: <Izzet Steam Maze>'s first ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2009/10/01: The controller of the spell that caused <Izzet Steam Maze>'s first ability to trigger also controls the copy. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2009/10/01: A copy is created even if the spell that caused <Izzet Steam Maze>'s first ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves.
2009/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless its controller chooses new ones. That player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one â€”" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. Its controller can't choose a different one.
2009/10/01: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Earthquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
2009/10/01: The controller of the copy can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.
2009/10/01: The copy that <Izzet Steam Maze>'s first ability creates is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Izzet Steam Maze>'s first ability itself) won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." This is called the "planeswalking ability."
2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.

2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.

2009/10/01: If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in their deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.
2009/10/01: If you use a card's flashback ability, you're actually casting that card. It moves from your graveyard to the stack. Abilities that trigger when you cast a spell will trigger. That spell can be countered.
2009/10/01: If you cast a card by using flashback, you cast that card from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost, but everything else about casting that spell works normally. You must follow timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery), as well as other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only before blockers are declared"). You may pay additional costs (such as kicker). Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will apply.
2009/10/01: As a spell cast with flashback resolves, it never goes to its owner's graveyard, so abilities that trigger on cards being put in a graveyard won't trigger. The card is exiled instead.
2009/10/01: If a spell cast by using flashback is countered, it's still exiled rather than being put into its owner's graveyard.
2009/10/01: If you use the flashback ability granted by <Otaria> to cast a split card from your graveyard, the flashback cost you pay is equal to the mana cost of the half that you're casting.
2009/10/01: If you use the flashback ability granted by <Otaria> to cast a card with X in its mana cost from your graveyard, you choose the value of X as you cast it. You'll still have to pay that X.
2009/10/01: <Otaria> may cause an instant or sorcery card in a graveyard to have multiple flashback abilities. Its owner may cast it using any one of those abilities.
2009/10/01: If you roll {CHAOS} multiple times in the same turn, you'll take that many extra turns after this one.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Wither applies to any damage, not just combat damage.
2009/10/01: The -1/-1 counters that result from wither remain on the damaged creature indefinitely. They won't be removed if the creature regenerates or the turn ends.
2009/10/01: Since damage from a creature with wither is real damage, it follows all the other rules for damage. It can be prevented or redirected. When it's dealt, it will cause "Whenever [this creature] deals damage" and "Whenever [this creature] is dealt damage" abilities to trigger.
2009/10/01: If the source of the damage is still on the battlefield at the time that damage is dealt, its characteristics are checked to see if it has wither. If the source has left the battlefield by then, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see if it had wither.
2009/10/01: Damage from creatures with wither affects players and planeswalkers normally.
2009/10/01: Multiple instances of wither are redundant.
2009/10/01: You must target three different creatures when the chaos ability triggers, even if that means you have to target creatures you control.

2012/06/01: Any -1/-1 counters that are placed on a creature because of wither or infect are also not doubled.
2012/06/01: The chaos ability is cumulative. For example, if you roll {CHAOS} twice in a turn, tapping a land for mana will cause two mana abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: A face-up plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence. In particular, it loses all counters it may have had.
2009/10/01: The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game.

2009/10/01: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.
2009/10/01: If the top card of your library changes during the process of casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until the process of casting the spell or activating the ability ends (all targets are chosen, all costs are paid, and so on).
2009/10/01: <Skybreen>'s second ability prevents each player from casting spells that share a card type with a card on top of any library, not just the one on top of that player's own library. This includes permanent spells (artifacts, creatures, enchantments, and planeswalkers), not just instant and sorcery spells.

2009/10/01: <Stronghold Furnace>'s first ability interacts with all damage, not just combat damage. Notably, it doubles the damage from its own chaos ability.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Suppose a spell would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let <Stronghold Furnace>'s effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
2009/10/01: If a spell or ability divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Pyrotechnics does), the damage is divided before <Stronghold Furnace>'s effect doubles it. The same is true for combat damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Multiverseid>423661</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/06/01: Rebound's delayed triggered ability will let you cast the spell at the beginning of your next upkeep even if the game has left <Trail of the Mage-Rings> by then.
2013/04/15: Similarly, if you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell with Commandeer, it will have rebound, but the ability won't do anything because that spell wasn't cast from your hand.
2013/04/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2013/04/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2013/04/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2013/04/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2013/04/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2013/04/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2013/04/15: Multiple instances of rebound on the same spell are redundant.
2013/04/15: The rebound effect is not optional. Each instant and sorcery spell you cast from your hand is exiled instead of being put into your graveyard as it resolves, whether you want it to be or not. Casting the spell during your next upkeep is optional, however.
2013/04/15: If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Arc Blade, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply.
2013/04/15: If a spell you cast from your hand has both rebound and buyback (and the buyback cost was paid), you choose which effect to apply as it resolves.
2013/04/15: You'll be able to cast a spell with flashback three times this way. First you can cast it from your hand. It will be exiled due to rebound as it resolves. Then you can cast it from exile due to rebound's delayed triggered ability. It will be put into your graveyard as it resolves. Then you can cast it from your graveyard due to flashback. It will be exiled due to flashback as it resolves.
2013/04/15: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand and it's exiled due to rebound, the delayed triggered ability will allow you to cast it during your next upkeep even if <Trail of the Mage-Rings> has been turned face down by then.
2013/04/15: If you cast a card from exile "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. Any X in the mana cost will be 0. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Momentous Fall does), you must pay those if you choose to cast the card.
2013/04/15: If a spell has restrictions on when it can be cast (for example, "Cast [this spell] only during the declare blockers step"), those restrictions may prevent you from casting it from exile during your upkeep.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell using the madness or suspend abilities, you're casting it from exile, not from your hand. Although those spells will have rebound, the ability won't have any effect.</Rulings>

For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then roll {CHAOS} while <Undercity Reaches> is the face-up plane card, you'll have no maximum hand size.

2012/06/01: If the top card of a player's library is a land card, you may play it only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2012/06/01: As soon as you finish playing the card on top of a player's library, the next card in that library becomes revealed.
2012/06/01: If a player draws multiple cards at once, they reveal each one before drawing it.
2012/06/01: Other players won't be able to play the top card of their libraries unless another effect allows it. If you and another player can play the top card of that player's library (because of some other effect), you'll be able to in most cases. This is because you have priority first at the beginning of each phase and step and after each spell or ability resolves. Once you play that card, it immediately moves from that library to the appropriate zone (the battlefield if it's a land card or the stack if it's a nonland card). The other player can't respond by playing that card.</Rulings>
