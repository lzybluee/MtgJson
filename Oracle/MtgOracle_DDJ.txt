<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: Dredge lets you replace any card draw, not just the one during your draw step.
2013/06/07: Once you decide to replace a draw using a card's dredge ability, that card can't be removed from your graveyard "in response." (Replacement effects don't use the stack.)
2013/06/07: You can't use dredge unless you're going to draw a card and the card with dredge is already in your graveyard.
2018/12/07: If you return <Golgari Grave-Troll> from your graveyard directly to the battlefield, its first ability counts itself.
2018/12/07: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to <Golgari Grave-Troll> may become lethal if you return remove +1/+1 counters from it during that turn. In this case, it dies before you can resolve the activated ability that will regenerate it.</Rulings>
