<CardText>When Banisher Priest enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Banisher Priest leaves the battlefield. (That creature returns under its owner's control.)</CardText>

<Artist>Willian Murai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>394353</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Banisher Priest>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Banisher Priest> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2013/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2013/07/01: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2013/07/01: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of <Banisher Priest>.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if <Banisher Priest>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Celestial Flare> targets only a player, not any creature. A creature with hexproof or protection from white can be sacrificed this way.
2013/07/01: If the player sacrifices a blocking creature, any attacking creature it was blocking remains blocked. Unless that attacking creature has trample or is being blocked by another creature, it won't assign or deal combat damage.
2013/07/01: Creatures continue to be attacking or blocking creatures through the end of combat step. It is possible to cast <Celestial Flare> within combat but after combat damage is dealt (specifically, during the combat damage step or the end of combat step). Only attacking and blocking creatures that survived combat damage can be sacrificed at this time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: Kiora's first ability can target any permanent an opponent controls, not just one that can deal or be dealt damage.
2014/02/01: Once the first ability resolves, the damage prevention continues to apply even if that permanent changes controllers.
2014/02/01: Kiora's second ability allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you won't play a land as that ability resolves. The ability will fully resolve (and you'll draw a card, perhaps a land you'll play later) first.
2014/02/01: The effect of the second ability is cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Rites of Flourishing.
2014/02/01: If Kiora leaves the battlefield after her second ability is activated but before it resolves, you'll still be able to play an additional land after the ability resolves.</Rulings>
