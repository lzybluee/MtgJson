<CardText>Knight of the Reliquary gets +1/+1 for each land card in your graveyard.
{T}, Sacrifice a Forest or Plains: Search your library for a land card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library.</CardText>
<Artist>Wayne Reynolds</Artist>
<Multiverseid>243416</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/11/17: <Knight of the Reliquary>'s first ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. In all other zones, it's a 2/2 creature.
2017/11/17: The activated ability's cost checks the land's subtype, not its name. You can sacrifice a nonbasic land this way as long as it has the subtype Forest or Plains. Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Horizon Canopy is neither a Forest nor a Plains, while Temple Garden is both.
2017/11/17: Sacrificing a Forest or Plains is part of the cost of <Knight of the Reliquary>'s activated ability. Assuming that sacrificing the land puts it into your graveyard, <Knight of the Reliquary>'s first ability will immediately give it an additional +1/+1 when that cost is paid because there'll be a new land card in your graveyard. Paying a cost can't be responded to (with Shock, for example).
2017/11/17: <Knight of the Reliquary>'s activated ability lets you find any land card, not just a basic land card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: If <Oblivion Ring> leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted nonland permanent forever.
2007/10/01: If there are no nonland permanents on the battlefield other than an <Oblivion Ring>, and the card it exiled was another <Oblivion Ring>, casting a third <Oblivion Ring> will result in an involuntary infinite loop that will end the game in a draw (unless someone chooses to break it by putting another nonland permanent onto the battlefield or destroying one of the <Oblivion Ring>s, for example).
2008/10/01: If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything, but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled forever.
2012/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</Rulings>

<CardText>Punishing Fire deals 2 damage to any target.
Whenever an opponent gains life, you may pay {R}. If you do, return Punishing Fire from your graveyard to your hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Greg Staples</Artist>
<Multiverseid>243483</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Punishing Fire>'s triggered ability triggers only if it's already in your graveyard at the time an opponent gains life. For example, you can cast it in response to a spell or ability that will cause an opponent to gain life. In that case, <Punishing Fire> will resolve first, so it will be in the graveyard by the time the opponent gains life. However, if you wait until an opponent actually gains life and then cast <Punishing Fire>, you won't be able to return it to your hand at that time.
2009/10/01: You choose whether to pay {R} as the triggered ability resolves.
2009/10/01: If <Punishing Fire> has left your graveyard by the time its triggered ability resolves, you may still pay {R}, but you won't return it to your hand. This is true even if <Punishing Fire> has left your graveyard and returned to it by the time its triggered ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>243493</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, basic landcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a basic land card. You don't choose the type of basic land card you'll find until you're performing the search. After you choose a basic land card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on a card being basic landcycled. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops a basic landcycling ability from being activated.
2009/02/01: Basic landcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with basic landcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose not to find a basic land card, even if there is one in your library.</Rulings>
