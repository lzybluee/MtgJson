<Rulings>2007/05/01: If <Sliver Legion> and two other Slivers are on the battlefield, for example, each of them gets +2/+2.
2013/07/01: Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like flying, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.
2013/07/01: If the creature type of a Sliver changes so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures.</Rulings>
