<Rulings>2016/06/08: While <Armadillo Cloak>'s last ability is similar to lifelink, it isn't lifelink—it's a normal triggered ability. If a creature you control with lifelink wears an <Armadillo Cloak> and deals damage, first you'll gain that much life for lifelink, and then <Armadillo Cloak>'s triggered ability is put onto the stack. This also means that multiple instances of <Armadillo Cloak>'s triggered ability do trigger separately.
2016/06/08: If <Armadillo Cloak> enchants a creature you don't control, you'll gain life when it deals damage, as long as that damage hasn't already caused you to lose the game.</Rulings>
