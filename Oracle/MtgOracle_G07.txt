2007/05/01: The choice is optional.
2007/05/01: If you fail to find something, you still exile this.

2009/10/01: You can't acquire exiled cards because those cards are still in one of the game's zones.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you cast a Buyback spell, then there will be two effects trying to replace where the card goes. You get to choose if the Buyback returns the card to your hand or the card gets exiled.
2004/10/04: If an effect asks you to discard a card, you can't "discard" something that is in your graveyard. Those cards are not in your hand. Thus, Cycling abilities of cards in the graveyard can't be activated.
2004/10/04: The second ability creates a replacement effect. It applies to both costs and effects.
2004/10/04: If you play a card using <Yawgmoth's Will> and something triggers only when "cast from your hand", that something will not trigger. Such things trigger based on where the card came from.
2004/10/04: To "play a card" is to either cast a spell or to put a land onto the battlefield using the main phase special action.
2004/10/04: It will exile itself since it goes to the graveyard after its effect starts.
2006/10/15: You cannot Suspend a card from your graveyard, only your hand.</Rulings>

<CardText>Create X 4/4 white Angel creature tokens with flying.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2018/03/16: A mana cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {8}{W}{W} to cast <Decree of Justice>.</Rulings>
