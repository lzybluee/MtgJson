<CardText>Bloodthirst 3 (If an opponent was dealt damage this turn, this creature enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it.)
Flying
Whenever you cast a Vampire creature spell, it gains bloodthirst 3.</CardText>
<Artist>Min Yum</Artist>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Multiple instances of bloodthirst are cumulative. For example, if you control <Bloodlord of Vaasgoth> and cast a Vampire creature spell that already has bloodthirst 1, that Vampire will enter the battlefield with four +1/+1 counters on it if an opponent has been dealt damage that turn.
2011/09/22: A creature spell like Phantasmal Image that may enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature is not a Vampire creature spell, even if you intend on copying a Vampire creature when that creature enters the battlefield.
2011/09/22: Vampire creatures you put directly onto the battlefield without casting them and Vampire creature tokens you put onto the battlefield will not gain bloodthirst 3 from <Bloodlord of Vaasgoth>.</Rulings>

Dungrove Elder's power and toughness are each equal to the number of Forests you control.</CardText>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: <Dungrove Elder>'s power and toughness are each equal to the number of lands you control with the land type Forest, not necessarily lands named Forest.
2011/09/22: <Dungrove Elder>'s power and toughness will change as the number of Forests you control changes.
2011/09/22: <Dungrove Elder>'s ability sets its power and toughness in all zones, not just the battlefield.</Rulings>

Play with the top card of your library revealed.
You may cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card. (Do this only any time you could cast that creature card. You still pay the spell's costs.)</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Normally, <Garruk's Horde> allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it at the time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
2011/09/22: You'll still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs.
2011/09/22: If the top card of your library is Dryad Arbor (the only card that's both a creature and a land), you can't play it this way. Dryad Arbor can't be cast as a spell.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>
