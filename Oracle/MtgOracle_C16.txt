<Rulings>2016/11/08: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker or put onto the battlefield attacking during this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2016/11/08: If you cast <Entrapment Maneuver> after combat damage has been dealt, only creatures that survived combat can be sacrificed.
2016/11/08: <Entrapment Maneuver> doesn't target the creature to be sacrificed. The target player chooses one as it resolves. No player may take any other actions between the target player choosing the creature and you creating Soldier tokens.
2016/11/08: To determine how many Soldier tokens are created, use the toughness of the sacrificed creature as it last existed on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/11/08: While resolving <Orzhov Advokist>'s ability, you choose a creature you control or choose not to put any counters on a creature, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by players who chose before them. Then simultaneously each player who chose a creature puts two +1/+1 counters on the creature they chose.
2016/11/08: <Orzhov Advokist>'s ability doesn't target the creatures that receive +1/+1 counters. Their controllers choose them as the ability resolves. Players can't take actions between making their choices and the +1/+1 counters being placed.
2016/11/08: If a player chooses to accept <Orzhov Advokist>'s gift, that player can't attack you or a planeswalker you control with any creatures during their next turn, even creatures that weren't on the battlefield as <Orzhov Advokist>'s ability resolved.
2016/11/08: <Orzhov Advokist>'s effect keeps creatures from attacking you even if <Orzhov Advokist> leaves the battlefield, if the creature that received counters is no longer on the battlefield, or if an effect has moved those counters off of the creature that received them and put them onto another creature.</Rulings>

Effects that interact with counters being put onto permanents (such as that of Corpsejack Menace or Fathom Mage) apply if appropriate. For example, if Corpsejack Menace has two +1/+1 counters and a divinity counter on it, <Deepglow Skate>'s ability gives Corpsejack Menace four more +1/+1 counters and one more divinity counter.

It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2016/11/08: The token is an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value of the token that other effects may copy.
2016/11/08: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2016/11/08: If the copied permanent is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that permanent copied.
2016/11/08: If the permanent copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.

<Rulings>2016/11/08: <Cruel Entertainment>'s controller may be one of its targets, even if it's less entertaining this way.
2016/11/08: If one player loses the game before controlling the other player, the other player takes their turn normally.
2016/11/08: The controlling player can't make the player being controlled concede. A player may choose to concede at any time, even while under another player's control.
2016/11/08: The player being controlled is still the active player during their turn.
2016/11/08: While controlling another player, the controlling player also continues to make their own choices and decisions.
2016/11/08: While controlling another player, the controlling player can see all cards in the game that the player being controlled can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library that they may look at.
2016/11/08: While controlling another player, the controlling player makes all choices and decisions that the player being controlled is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. This includes choices about what spells to cast or what abilities to activate, as well as any decisions called for by a triggered ability or anything else.
2016/11/08: The controlling player can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices—that player can't do anything that the player being controlled couldn't do. The controlling player can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the player being controlled would normally make (as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. In other words, if the player being controlled wouldn't make a decision, the controlling player can't make that decision on their behalf.
2016/11/08: The controlling player also can't make any choices or decisions for the player being controlled that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2016/11/08: The controlling player only controls the player. The controlling player doesn't control any of that player's permanents, spells, or abilities.
2016/11/08: The controlling player can use only the resources of the player being controlled (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; the controlling player can't use their own resources to pay costs for the player being controlled. Similarly, the controlling player can't spend the resources of the player being controlled on any of the controlling player's own costs.
2016/11/08: If a player who would be controlled skips their next turn, the other player will control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
2016/11/08: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
2016/11/08: Controlling a player doesn't allow the controlling player to look at the controlled player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, the controlling player can't have that player choose a card.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Felix</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420671</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. Colorless is not a color.
2016/11/08: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2016/11/08: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes <Crystalline Crawler> cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} to cast it and have it enter the battlefield with five +1/+1 counters.
2016/11/08: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420672</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/11/08: The colors of mana that <Prismatic Geoscope> can produce aren't related to the specific basic land types among lands you control. For example, if you control a Plains and an Island, you can activate <Prismatic Geoscope>'s ability to add {R}{G}.
2016/11/08: You can activate <Prismatic Geoscope>'s mana ability if you have no basic land types among lands you control, but it won't produce any mana.
2016/11/08: <Prismatic Geoscope> can't produce colorless mana.
2016/11/08: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look for the Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest subtypes among the lands you control. Count each subtype that appears one or more times toward the number of basic land types among lands you control. This number can't exceed five.
2016/11/08: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests are the same as one Forest.
2016/11/08: Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Caves of Koilos is neither a Plains nor a Swamp.
2016/11/08: Some nonbasic lands do have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control—they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, a Blood Crypt, and a Forest, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege.

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
2014/07/18: Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected.
2014/07/18: Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with Mercurial Pretender, are also unaffected.
2014/07/18: <Hushwing Gryff>'s ability stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.
2014/07/18: The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, Amulet of Vigor says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would not trigger. If a land (that isn't also a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, Amulet of Vigor's ability would trigger.
2014/07/18: Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control March of the Machines, which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," each artifact will be a creature at the time it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
2014/07/18: If <Hushwing Gryff> and another creature enter the battlefield at the same time, neither creature entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jim Murray</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420691</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.

<Artist>Dan Dos Santos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420699</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "play this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420703</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: Multiple instances of convoke on a single spell are redundant.
2014/07/18: The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
2014/07/18: Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
2014/07/18: When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
2014/07/18: Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
2014/07/18: Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
2014/07/18: When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling (a spell with convoke and mana cost {X}{G}{G}{G}) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
2014/07/18: If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
2018/07/13: You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2018/07/13: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2018/07/13: You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
2018/07/13: You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
2018/07/13: You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card's type.
2018/07/13: Miracle is an alternative cost to cast the spell with miracle. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a miracle cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
2018/07/13: You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.</Rulings>

2012/07/01: If one of <Spelltwine>'s targets is illegal when <Spelltwine> tries to resolve, you'll still exile and copy the remaining legal target.

2012/07/01: The copy you cast first will already be on the stack when you cast the other copy. If that spell targets a spell, you may choose the first copy as a legal target.
2012/07/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2012/07/01: If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2011/01/01: If a permanent chosen this way has multiple kinds of counters on it, only a single new counter is put on that permanent.

<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420718</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: The rules for delve have changed slightly since it was last in an expansion. Previously, delve reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under the current rules, you exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/09/20: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, Dead Drop's converted mana cost is 10 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2014/09/20: You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
2014/09/20: You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than nine cards from your graveyard to cast Dead Drop.
2014/09/20: Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.</Rulings>

2014/11/24: You'll choose how each creature controlled by an opponent blocks, even if that creature wasn't on the battlefield or wasn't controlled by an opponent as the activated ability resolved.
2014/11/24: In a multiplayer game, if more than one player activates <Brutal Hordechief>'s activated ability on the same turn, the controller of the last ability to resolve will choose how any creatures controlled by players who didn't resolve this ability will block.
2014/11/24: The defending player affected by <Brutal Hordechief>'s triggered ability is determined relative to the creature that attacked. For example, if <Brutal Hordechief> attacked one opponent and two other creatures you control attacked another opponent, the first opponent would lose 1 life and the second opponent would lose 2 life.

<Artist>YW Tang</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420728</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The pile is shuffled to disguise from your opponents which manifested creature is which. After you manifest the cards, you can look at them.
2014/11/24: If you manifest a card owned by an opponent and you leave the game, that card is exiled.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: The total cost to cast <Blasphemous Act> is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if there are three creatures on the battlefield, including one you can sacrifice to add {C}, the total cost of <Blasphemous Act> is {5}{R}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
2011/09/22: <Blasphemous Act>'s ability can't reduce the total cost to cast the spell below {R}.
2011/09/22: Although players may respond to <Blasphemous Act> once it's been cast, once it's announced, they can't respond before the cost is calculated and paid.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: The owner of a token is the player under whose control the token was put onto the battlefield. If a token is shuffled into a player's library this way, that player shuffles before revealing the top card of that library.
2011/09/22: If the permanent is an illegal target by the time <Chaos Warp> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will occur. No library will be shuffled and no card will be revealed.
2011/09/22: A permanent card is a card with one or more of the following card types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker.
2011/09/22: If the revealed card is a permanent card but can't enter the battlefield (perhaps because it's an Aura with nothing to enchant), it remains on top of that library.

2010/03/01: As the ability resolves, you can't put the Ogre token onto the battlefield without explicitly giving the attacking player the option to pay {3}, even if the attacking player has forgotten about this ability.
2010/03/01: The ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step. If you put an Ogre token onto the battlefield as a result, you may block with it during that combat phase.
2010/03/01: If an attacking creature has a "Whenever this creature attacks" ability, that ability is put on the stack first, then Kazuul's ability is put on the stack. Although Kazuul's ability will resolve first, and potentially create an Ogre token, any target of the other ability will already have been chosen at this point, and thus could not have been the new Ogre token.
2010/03/01: In a multiplayer game, the ability checks whether you're the defending player for each individual attacking creature. For example, if one creature attacks you and two creatures attack another player, Kazuul's ability triggers just once.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>420755</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: Turning a face-down creature with megamorph face up and putting a +1/+1 counter on it is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/02/25: If a face-down creature with megamorph is turned face up some other way (for example, if you manifest a card with megamorph and then pay its mana cost to turn it face up), you won't put a +1/+1 counter on it.
2015/02/25: Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. You can find more information on morph on cards with morph from the Khans of Tarkir set.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: You may sacrifice only creatures that are already on the battlefield. If a creature with devour and another creature are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, the creature with devour can't devour that other creature.

<Rulings>2014/11/07: Lieutenant abilities apply only if your commander is on the battlefield and under your control.
2014/11/07: Lieutenant abilities refer only to whether you control your commander, not any other player's commander.
2014/11/07: If you gain control of a creature with a lieutenant ability owned by another player, that ability will check to see if you control your commander and will apply if you do. It won't check whether its owner controls their commander.
2014/11/07: If you lose control of your commander, lieutenant abilities of creatures you control will immediately stop applying. If this causes a creature's toughness to become less than or equal to the amount of damage marked on it, the creature will be destroyed.
2014/11/07: If a triggered ability granted by a lieutenant ability triggers, and in response to that trigger you lose control of your commander (causing the lieutenant to lose that ability), that triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

2009/02/01: <Blood Tyrant>'s third ability will trigger no matter how a player loses the game: due to a state-based action (as a result of having a life total of 0 or less, trying to draw a card from an empty library, or having ten poison counters), a spell or ability that says that player loses the game, a concession, or a game loss awarded by a judge.
2009/02/01: In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (such as a Grand Melee game), if a spell or ability says that you win the game, it instead causes all of your opponents within your range of influence to lose the game. This is another way by which <Blood Tyrant>'s third ability can trigger.</Rulings>

<CardText>Evolve (Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature has greater power or toughness than this creature, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)
Whenever a +1/+1 counter is put on Fathom Mage, you may draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420815</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: If multiple +1/+1 counters are placed on <Fathom Mage> simultaneously, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.
2013/01/24: If <Fathom Mage> enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it (perhaps due to Master Biomancer), its last ability will trigger once for each +1/+1 counter it entered the battlefield with.
2013/01/24: <Fathom Mage>'s last ability will trigger whenever any +1/+1 counter is placed on it, not just ones due to the evolve ability.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

2014/04/26: If a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not, for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2014/04/26: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and all creature subtypes. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2014/04/26: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2014/04/26: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat.
2014/04/26: If a God is dealt damage, then stops being a creature, then becomes a creature again later in the same turn, the damage will still be marked on it. This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)
2014/04/26: Your devotion to two colors is equal to the number of mana symbols that are the first color, the second color, or both colors among the mana costs of permanents you control. Specifically, a hybrid mana symbol counts only once toward your devotion to its two colors. For example, if the only nonland permanents you control are Pharika, God of Affliction and Golgari Guildmage (whose mana cost is {B/G}{B/G}), your devotion to black and green is four.
2014/04/26: Numeric mana symbols ({0}, {1}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2014/04/26: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2014/04/26: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: <Progenitor Mimic> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/04/15: The original <Progenitor Mimic> will create tokens, but those token copies will not.
2013/04/15: If you choose to have <Progenitor Mimic> enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature, the triggered ability it gains will become part of its copiable values. For example, suppose <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost {1}{G}. The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost {1}{G} and with "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature." If another <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with two instances of the triggered ability.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature is a token, <Progenitor Mimic> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Copying a token doesn't make <Progenitor Mimic> become a token.
2013/04/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2013/04/15: If <Progenitor Mimic> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2013/04/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Artist>Clint Cearley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420846</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: You'll draw cards before deciding which creature (if any) <Whispering Madness> will be encoded on.
2013/01/24: Each player draws cards simultaneously. If this causes a player to draw more cards than are left in their library, that player will lose the game. If this causes all players to do so, the game is a draw. (In multiplayer games, multiple players drawing from an empty library will cause those players to lose although the game may continue.)
2013/04/15: If a creature with an encoded card deals combat damage to more than one player simultaneously (perhaps because some of the combat damage was redirected), the triggered ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to. Each ability will create a copy of the exiled card and allow you to cast it.
2013/04/15: The exiled card with cipher grants a triggered ability to the creature it's encoded on. If that creature loses that ability and subsequently deals combat damage to a player, the triggered ability won't trigger. However, the exiled card will continue to be encoded on that creature.
2013/04/15: If another player gains control of the creature, that player will control the triggered ability. That player will create a copy of the encoded card and may cast it.
2013/04/15: The spell with cipher is encoded on the creature as part of that spell's resolution, just after the spell's other effects. That card goes directly from the stack to exile. It never goes to the graveyard.
2013/04/15: You choose the creature as the spell resolves. The cipher ability doesn't target that creature, although the spell with cipher may target that creature (or a different creature) because of its other abilities.
2013/04/15: If the spell with cipher doesn't resolve, none of its effects will happen, including cipher. The card will go to its owner's graveyard and won't be encoded on a creature.
2013/04/15: If the creature leaves the battlefield, the exiled card will no longer be encoded on any creature. It will stay exiled.
2013/04/15: If you want to encode the card with cipher onto a noncreature permanent such as a Keyrune that can turn into a creature, that permanent has to be a creature before the spell with cipher starts resolving. You can choose only a creature to encode the card onto.
2013/04/15: The copy of the card with cipher is created in and cast from exile.
2013/04/15: You cast the copy of the card with cipher during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type.
2013/04/15: If you choose not to cast the copy, or you can't cast it (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are performed. You won't get a chance to cast the copy at a later time.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: Effects that would replace gaining life with some other effect won't be able to do anything because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2008/05/01: Effects that replace an event with gaining life (like Words of Worship's effect does) will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2008/05/01: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number, and that number is higher than your current life total, that effect will normally cause you to gain life equal to the difference. With <Everlasting Torment> on the battlefield, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than your current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2008/05/01: The "damage can't be prevented" statement overrides all forms of preventing damage, including protection abilities. Damage prevention spells and abilities can still be cast and played; they just don't do anything.
2008/05/01: Spells and abilities that replace or redirect damage aren't affected by <Everlasting Torment>'s second ability. They'll work as normal.

<Rulings>2008/05/01: Each other creature copies the printed values of the targeted creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to that creature. They won't copy other effects that have changed the targeted creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. They also won't copy counters on the targeted creature (they'll each just retain the counters they already have).
2008/05/01: If the targeted creature is itself copying a creature, each other creature will become whatever it's copying, as modified by that copy effect. For example, if you target a Cemetery Puca that's copying a Grizzly Bears (a 2/2 creature with no abilities), each other creature will become a Grizzly Bears with the Cemetery Puca ability.
2008/05/01: This effect can cause each other creature to stop being a creature. For example, if you target an animated Mutavault (a land with an activated ability that turns it into a creature), only the printed wording will be copied — the "becomes a creature" effect won't. Each other creature will become an unanimated Mutavault.
2008/05/01: Noncopy effects that have already applied to the other creatures will continue to apply to them. For example, if Giant Growth had given one of them +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then <Mirrorweave> made it a copy of Grizzly Bears, it will be a 5/5 Grizzly Bears.
2008/05/01: If the targeted creature is a token, each other creature copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Those creatures don't become tokens.
2008/05/01: As the turn ends, the other creatures revert to what they were before. If two <Mirrorweave>s are cast on the same turn, they'll both wear off at the same time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: Casting a card by using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: You're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
2008/08/01: A retrace card cast from your graveyard follows the normal timing rules for its card type.
2008/08/01: When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.
2008/08/01: If the active player casts a spell that has retrace, that player may cast that card again after it resolves, before another player can remove the card from the graveyard. The active player has priority after the spell resolves, so they can immediately cast a new spell. Since casting a card with retrace from the graveyard moves that card onto the stack, no one else would have the chance to affect it while it's still in the graveyard.
2008/08/01: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying — or, if that creature is itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ron Brown</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420863</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: If a nontoken creature that gains persist this way is put into a graveyard, that card will be returned to the battlefield with a -1/-1 counter on it. However, because it's a new object with no relation to its previous existence, the returned creature will not have persist.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

—Pulan, Bant orchardist</Flavor>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420912</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Exotic Orchard> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Exotic Orchard>, you can tap <Exotic Orchard> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, <Exotic Orchard> takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an <Exotic Orchard>, and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: At the time the ability resolves, you'll get to play the card if you declared three different creatures as attackers at any point in the turn. A creature declared as an attacker in two different attack phases counts only once. A creature that entered the battlefield attacking (such as a token created by Militia's Pride) doesn't count because you never attacked with it.</Rulings>
