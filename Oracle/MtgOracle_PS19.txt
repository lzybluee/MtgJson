<CardText>Double strike
Whenever you cast a creature spell, create a 4/4 black Zombie Warrior creature token with vigilance.
When God-Eternal Oketra dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.</CardText>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Oketra's first triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2019/05/03: In the Commander format, a commander's color identity isn't affected by color words (such as black) appearing in its text. If <God-Eternal Oketra> is your commander, your deck can't contain black mana symbols.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

You may reveal the first card you draw each turn as you draw it. Whenever you reveal an instant or sorcery card this way, copy that card and you may cast the copy. That copy costs {2} less to cast.
When God-Eternal Kefnet dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.</CardText>
<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If you reveal a card this way, it remains revealed until Kefnet's triggered ability finishes resolving.
2019/05/03: It's important to reveal the first card you draw each turn (or choose not to reveal it) before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand. You look at the card as you draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.
2019/05/03: You don't have to reveal a drawn card if you don't wish to copy it at that time.
2019/05/03: You can reveal and copy an instant or sorcery card this way on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2019/05/03: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and copied with Kefnet's ability.
2019/05/03: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2019/05/03: You can cast the copy only as Kefnet's triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy ceases to exist. You can't cast it later.
2019/05/03: You can cast the copy during the resolution of the triggered ability if it's a sorcery, no matter whose turn it is or which phase it is.
2019/05/03: If the card leaves your hand before Kefnet's triggered ability resolves, you'll copy it using its last known information.
2019/05/03: The copy is created in and cast from your hand.
2019/05/03: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Kefnet's ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/05/03: If you somehow control more than one <God-Eternal Kefnet> (perhaps because one is a Spark Double), you may reveal a card you draw for any number of their abilities. One at a time, each will copy the card if it's an instant or sorcery, and you may cast each of them. Each copy resolves before you cast the next, and each copy's cost is reduced by only {2}.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.

When God-Eternal Bontu enters the battlefield, sacrifice any number of other permanents, then draw that many cards.
When God-Eternal Bontu dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.</CardText>
<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: As Bontu's first triggered ability resolves, you may choose to sacrifice zero other permanents.
2019/05/03: If any abilities trigger as you sacrifice other permanents, those abilities won't be put onto the stack until after you've drawn cards.
2019/05/03: If a second <God-Eternal Bontu> enters the battlefield under your control, you'll put one into your graveyard before you can sacrifice anything to the new Bontu's triggered ability.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.

2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect.

If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.

When God-Eternal Rhonas enters the battlefield, double the power of each other creature you control until end of turn. Those creatures gain vigilance until end of turn.
When God-Eternal Rhonas dies or is put into exile from the battlefield, you may put it into its owner's library third from the top.</CardText>
<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: Rhonas's first triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't have their power doubled or gain vigilance.
2019/05/03: If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.

<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Bolas (Loyalty: 4)</Type>
<ManaCost>UBBBR (5)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God has all loyalty abilities of all other planeswalkers on the battlefield.
[+1]: You draw a card. Each opponent exiles a card from their hand or a permanent they control.
[-3]: Destroy target creature or planeswalker.
[-8]: Each opponent who doesn't control a legendary creature or planeswalker loses the game.</CardText>
<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: Nicol Bolas doesn't remove loyalty abilities from the other planeswalkers.
2019/05/03: Nicol Bolas doesn't gain any static or triggered abilities of other planeswalkers or any activated abilities they may have that aren't loyalty abilities.
2019/05/03: While Nicol Bolas may end up with an astonishing number of loyalty abilities, you can still activate only one loyalty ability of <Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God> each turn.
2019/05/03: If a loyalty ability of a planeswalker references the card it's printed on by name, treat Nicol Bolas's instance of that ability as though it referenced <Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God> by name instead. For instance, if Nahiri, Storm of Stone is on the battlefield, Nicol Bolas deals the damage if you activate the ability he gained from her.
2019/05/03: If an ability of a planeswalker exiles cards and another loyalty ability of that planeswalker references the exiled cards, those abilities are linked. If Nicol Bolas gains both abilities, the instances he has are similarly linked. Cards exiled by any other abilities Nicol Bolas has (such as his own first loyalty ability) won't be seen by those linked abilities.
2019/05/03: If any abilities trigger as you draw a card while resolving Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability, those abilities don't resolve until after your opponents have exiled a card or permanent.
2019/05/03: After you draw a card as Nicol Bolas's first loyalty ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a permanent they control or chooses a card in hand without revealing that card. Then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Finally, all of the chosen cards are exiled simultaneously.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, if one player on a team loses the game, the entire team loses the game, even if the other player controls a legendary creature or planeswalker.</Rulings>
