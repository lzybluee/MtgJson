<Artist>Wayne Reynolds</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370750</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: The ability doesn't trigger until the enchantment enters the battlefield. This means that, for example, you can't cast an Aura with enchant creature if there are no legal targets available, hoping to enchant the Cat token. <Ajani's Chosen> itself, however, may be a legal target for the Aura.
2013/07/01: If you cast an Aura targeting an opponent or a permanent controlled by an opponent, you control that Aura when it enters the battlefield. The ability of <Ajani's Chosen> will trigger.
2013/07/01: You may attach the Aura to the token only if it can legally enchant that token. For example, if the enchantment that entered the battlefield is an Aura with "enchant land," it won't move.
2013/07/01: You may attach the Aura to the Cat token only if the Aura and the token are both on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves. If the Aura leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, it won't become attached to the token. If the token leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, the Aura won't move.</Rulings>

For example, if you start the turn at 10 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 6 life later that turn, the ability will trigger.
2017/11/17: If you haven't gained 4 or more life during the turn when the end step begins, the ability won't trigger at all. Gaining life during the end step won't cause the ability to trigger.

<Rulings>2017/11/17: <Archangel of Thune>'s last ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Auriok Champion or 6 life from Tavern Swindler.
2017/11/17: If a creature you control is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from <Archangel of Thune>'s last ability in time to save it.
2017/11/17: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Archangel of Thune>'s last ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2017/11/17: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

<Artist>Willian Murai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370624</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Banisher Priest>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Banisher Priest> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2013/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2013/07/01: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2013/07/01: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Banisher Priest> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of <Banisher Priest>.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if <Banisher Priest>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: If a creature you control is dealt damage at the same time that you gain life (most likely because a source you control with lifelink deals damage at the same time), and your life total becomes greater than or equal to your starting life total, apply <Path of Bravery>'s effect before considering whether or not the damage dealt to that creature is lethal.
2017/11/17: <Path of Bravery>'s triggered ability triggers only once, after attacking creatures are declared. For example, if you attack with five creatures, you'll gain 5 life as a single event.
2017/11/17: If a creature enters the battlefield attacking after attacking creatures have been declared, the ability won't trigger again because you didn't declare that creature as an attacking creature. However, if such a creature enters the battlefield before the ability resolves, it will be counted when determining how much life is gained.</Rulings>

2007/07/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Clone> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2009/10/01: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2012/07/01: <Clone> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below).

<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370685</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Colossal Whale>'s triggered ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step, before blocking creatures are declared.
2013/07/01: <Colossal Whale>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Colossal Whale> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2013/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2013/07/01: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2013/07/01: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of <Colossal Whale>.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if <Colossal Whale>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2013/07/01: If the exiled card is a split card, then X is determined by the combined mana cost of both halves. However, when you cast the copy, you choose only one half to cast. You may cast a different half each time you create and cast a copy.

<Rulings>2013/07/01: The ability checks to see if the enchanted Equipment is attached to a creature as your upkeep begins. If it's not, the ability won't trigger at all. If it is, the ability will check again as it tries to resolve. If the enchanted Equipment isn't attached to a creature at that time, the ability won't do anything.
2013/07/01: This ability triggers at the beginning of the upkeep of the controller of <Artificer's Hex>, not the upkeep of the controller of the enchanted Equipment or the creature that Equipment is attached to.
2013/07/01: Players can't pay an Equipment's equip cost to unattach that Equipment to stop <Artificer's Hex> from destroying a creature.
2013/07/01: In some rare cases, the creature the enchanted Equipment is attached to as the ability resolves isn't the same one as the one it was attached to when it triggered. In such a case, the creature the Equipment is attached to when the ability resolves is destroyed.</Rulings>

<Artist>Wesley Burt</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370709</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: Activating <Vampire Warlord>'s ability causes a "regeneration shield" to be created for it. The next time that creature would be destroyed that turn, the regeneration shield is used up instead. This works only if the creature is dealt lethal damage, dealt damage from a source with deathtouch, or affected by a spell or ability that says to "destroy" it. Other effects that cause the creature to be put into the graveyard (such as reducing its toughness to 0 or sacrificing it) don't destroy it, so regeneration won't save it. If the regeneration shield isn't used, it goes away as the turn ends.
2013/07/01: To work, the regeneration shield must be created before <Vampire Warlord> is destroyed. This usually means activating its ability during the declare blockers step, or in response to a spell or ability that would destroy it.
2013/07/01: If <Vampire Warlord> is dealt lethal damage and is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch during the same combat damage step, a single regeneration shield will save it.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: If the first ability resolves but the damage is prevented or redirected, the target creature still won't be able to block that turn.
2014/07/18: The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Playing it follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2014/07/18: If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/07/18: In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
2014/07/18: While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
2014/07/18: While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
2014/07/18: Because you're casting the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/07/18: If the copied card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copies.</Rulings>

—Scriptus Fleen, flectomancer</Flavor>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370790</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Wild Ricochet> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2013/07/01: When <Wild Ricochet> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. The controller of the original spell retains control of that spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2013/07/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Volcanic Geyser does), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/07/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Wild Ricochet>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/07/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has "{1}{G}: Regenerate this creature." (The next time the creature would be destroyed this turn, it isn't. Instead tap it, remove all damage from it, and remove it from combat.)</CardText>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370664</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Activating the ability granted to the enchanted creature causes a "regeneration shield" to be created for it. The next time that creature would be destroyed that turn, the regeneration shield is used up instead. This works only if the creature is dealt lethal damage, dealt damage from a source with deathtouch, or affected by a spell or ability that says to "destroy" it. Other effects that cause the creature to be put into the graveyard (such as reducing its toughness to 0 or sacrificing it) don't destroy it, so regeneration won't save it. If it hasn't been used, the regeneration shield goes away as the turn ends.
2011/09/22: To work, the regeneration shield must be created before the enchanted creature is destroyed. This usually means activating its ability during the declare blockers step, or in response to a spell or ability that would destroy it.
2011/09/22: If the enchanted creature is dealt lethal damage and is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch during the same combat damage step, a single regeneration shield will save it.
2013/07/01: <Trollhide> needs to be attached to the creature as the ability that creates the regeneration shield is activated, but after that, the regeneration shield will be created and remain in effect even if <Trollhide> is no longer attached to the creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/07/01: The ability that triggers when <Vastwood Hydra> dies doesn't target any of the creatures. You can choose to put counters on a creature with protection from green, for example.
2013/07/01: You choose how the counters will be distributed when the ability resolves.
2013/07/01: In some unusual cases, <Vastwood Hydra> will have enough -1/-1 counters put on it to make its toughness 0 or less. If this happens, the ability will still distribute a number of +1/+1 counters equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on <Vastwood Hydra> before the -1/-1 counters were put on it. For example, if <Vastwood Hydra> has two +1/+1 counters on it and three -1/-1 counters are put on it, two +1/+1 counters will be distributed.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: Each of these artifacts cares about any land with the appropriate basic land type. For example, Staff of the Sun Magus's ability triggers when any land with the subtype Plains enters the battlefield under your control, not just lands named Plains.
2014/07/18: Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Caves of Koilos is neither a Plains nor a Swamp. Having one enter the battlefield under your control won't cause Staff of the Sun Magus's ability to trigger.
2014/07/18: If you cast a copy of a card that's a certain color, the appropriate Staff's ability will trigger. However, if you copy a spell on the stack without casting that copy, it will not.</Rulings>

<Name>Strionic Resonator</Name>
<Type>Artifact</Type>
<ManaCost>2 (2)</ManaCost>
<CardText>{2}, {T}: Copy target triggered ability you control. You may choose new targets for the copy. (A triggered ability uses the words "when," "whenever," or "at.")</CardText>
<Flavor>Its tines cannot be rung by mere physical force. Only magic of great power can start its eldritch resonance.</Flavor>
<Artist>Noah Bradley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>370670</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
2018/03/16: <Strionic Resonator> targets a triggered ability that has triggered and is on the stack and creates another instance of that ability on the stack. It doesn't cause any object to gain an ability.
2018/03/16: The source of the copy is the same as the source of the original ability.
2018/03/16: If the triggered ability is modal (that is, if it says, "Choose one —" or similar), the mode is copied and can't be changed.
2018/03/16: If the triggered ability divides damage or distributes counters among a number of targets (for example, the ability of Bogardan Hellkite), the division and number of targets can't be changed. If you choose new targets, you must choose the same number of targets.
2018/03/16: Any choices made when the triggered ability resolves won't have been made yet when it's copied. Any such choices will be made separately when the copy resolves. If the triggered ability asks you to pay a cost (such as that of Frenzied Goblin), you pay that cost for the copy.
2018/03/16: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, copies of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by the triggered ability and the copy. For example, if Fiend Hunter's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied and two creatures are exiled, they both return when Fiend Hunter leaves the battlefield.
2018/03/16: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>
