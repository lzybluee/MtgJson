<Rulings>2010/06/15: The effect doesn't wear off until just before your next untap step (even if an effect will cause that untap step to be skipped).
2010/06/15: This ability applies no matter who or what the damage would be dealt to: a creature, a player, or a planeswalker. It also doesn't matter who controls the source.
2010/06/15: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would be dealt damage or the controller of the permanent that would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn" and Lava Axe says "Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker." Suppose a Lava Axe would deal 5 damage to a player who has cast Mending Hands targeting themselves. The player who would be dealt damage can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let this scheme's effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
2010/06/15: If a spell or ability divides damage among multiple recipients (such as Fireball does), the damage is divided before this effect doubles it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chuck Lukacs</Artist>
<Multiverseid>212597</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: As an opponent's untap step begins, if you control this face-up scheme card, all your permanents untap during that untap step. You have no choice about what untaps. Those permanents untap at the same time as the active players' permanents.
2010/06/15: Since your opponents take a shared team turn, they all have the same untap step. Your permanents untap just once during that step, no matter how many opponents you have.
2010/06/15: During an opponent's untap step, effects that would otherwise cause your permanents to stay tapped don't apply because they apply only during *your* untap step. For example, if you control a Deep-Slumber Titan (a creature that says "Deep-Slumber Titan doesn't untap during your untap step"), you untap Deep-Slumber Titan during each opponent's untap step.
2010/06/15: Controlling more than one face-up <I Know All, I See All> card is redundant. You can't untap your permanents more than once in a single untap step.
2010/06/15: The last ability won't trigger at all unless, as an end step starts, three or more cards have already been put into your graveyard that turn. Those cards don't still need to be in your graveyard at that time.
2010/06/15: The last ability of this scheme counts the number of cards put into your graveyard over the course of the entire turn, even if it wasn't face up the whole time. Specifically, during the turn you set this scheme in motion, its last ability will count cards that were put into your graveyard during your upkeep or draw step.
2010/06/15: The last ability doesn't count tokens that were put into your graveyard from the battlefield, because they're not cards. The same is true for copies of spells that were put into your graveyard when they resolved or were countered.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ralph Horsley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>212587</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: You can target any permanent an opponent controls, not just a creature.
2010/06/15: The token that's put onto the battlefield copies exactly what's printed on the targeted permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or it's a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or whether it's been affected by any noncopy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2010/06/15: If the targeted permanent is copying something else when the ability resolves (for example, if it's a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that permanent is copying.
2010/06/15: If the targeted permanent is a token, the new token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2010/06/15: If the targeted permanent has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2010/06/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the targeted permanent will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of that permanent will also work.
2010/06/15: If the targeted permanent leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't get a token.
2010/06/15: If the targeted permanent is an Aura, you choose a legal permanent, player, or other card for the token to enchant as it enters the battlefield. A permanent you choose must be able to be enchanted by the token. (For example, if the Aura it's copying is red and has "enchant creature," the permanent must be a creature, and it can't have protection from red.) Since the token Aura wasn't cast as a spell, it doesn't target what it will enchant; you may choose something that has shroud, for example. As the ability resolves, no player can respond between the time you choose what the token will enchant and the time it enters the battlefield. If you can't choose something for the token to enchant, it enters the battlefield unattached, then is put into your graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

If there's a cost with having that creature attack its owner, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so you may have it attack another player, attack a planeswalker an opponent controls, or not attack at all.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: You choose a total of one card, and that card can't be a creature or a land.
2010/06/15: If you choose a card, you cast it as part of the resolution of this ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only during your end step").
2010/06/15: If you choose a card you can't cast (because there are no legal targets for the spell, for example), nothing happens to it. It remains in its owner's hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," the value of any X in the card's mana cost must be 0. You can't pay any alternative costs for that card. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or replicate), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Fling does), you must pay those when you cast the card.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Matson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>212601</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: The targeted opponent may choose a creature they control, or may choose a creature one of your other opponents controls. The same is true for each of the other permanent types listed.
2010/06/15: The four permanents are put on top of their owners' libraries in sequence. That means that a single artifact creature, for example, can't be chosen as both the creature and as the artifact.
2010/06/15: If there are no applicable choices for one of the permanent types, it's simply skipped. The process is still repeated for the other listed permanent types.
2010/06/15: If a player owns multiple permanents chosen this way, that player shuffles their library just once.

<Rulings>2010/06/15: You're the defending player if a creature is attacking you or a planeswalker you control.
2010/06/15: For each unblocked creature attacking you, you must put a Plant token onto the battlefield blocking it, even if you don't want to.
2010/06/15: The Plant token blocks the attacking creature even if the block couldn't legally be declared (for example, if the attacking creature has flying).
2010/06/15: Putting a blocking creature onto the battlefield doesn't trigger "Whenever a creature blocks" abilities. It also won't check blocking restrictions, costs, or requirements.
2010/06/15: Putting a blocking creature onto the battlefield will trigger "When this creature becomes blocked by a creature" abilities. It will also trigger "When this creature becomes blocked" abilities in this case, because the attacking creature had not yet been blocked that combat.
2010/06/15: The last ability triggers only if four or more creatures were declared as attackers during your opponents' declare attackers step. Only creatures attacking you are counted; creatures attacking your planeswalkers are not. The creatures may be controlled by different players.</Rulings>

2010/06/15: The last ability won't trigger at all unless, as an end step starts, you have already been dealt 5 or more damage that turn. It doesn't matter whether any of it was combat damage or not, nor does it matter who controlled the sources of that damage. (In other words, it will count damage dealt to you by sources you control.)
