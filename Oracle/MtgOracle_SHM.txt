<Rulings>2008/05/01: <Boon Reflection> doesn't cause you to gain life. Rather, it causes life-gaining effects to have you gain more life.
2008/05/01: The effects of multiple <Boon Reflection>s are cumulative. For example, if you have three <Boon Reflection>s on the battlefield, you'll gain eight times the original amount of life.
2008/05/01: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number, and that number is higher than your current life total, that effect will cause you to gain life equal to the difference. <Boon Reflection> will double that number. For example, if you have 13 life and Blessed Wind causes your life total to become 20, your life total will actually become 27.
2008/05/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, only <Boon Reflection>'s controller is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, <Boon Reflection> will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the shared team life total.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: If a player has protection from a chosen name, it means three things:

2018/12/07: <Runed Halo> doesn't give your permanents protection from the chosen name, only you.
2018/12/07: You can still be attacked by creatures with the chosen name, even though they won't deal combat damage to you.
2018/12/07: You'll have protection from the name, not from the word. For example, if you choose the name Shapeshifter, you'll have protection from anything named "Shapeshifter," but you won't have protection from other creatures with the creature type "Shapeshifter."
2018/12/07: You must choose the name of a card, not the name of a token. For example, you can't choose "Saproling" or "Marit Lage." However, if a token happens to have the same name as a card (such as "Shapeshifter" or "Spark Elemental"), you can choose it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Spectral Procession> is white even if you spend six blue mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Spectral Procession> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {W}{W}{W} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Spectral Procession> by spending {W}{W}{W}, {2}{W}{W}, {4}{W}, or {6}.</Rulings>

Persist (When this creature dies, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a -1/-1 counter on it.)</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>152060</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Advice from the Fae> is blue, even if you spend six black mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Advice from the Fae> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {U}{U}{U} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Advice from the Fae> by spending {U}{U}{U}, {2}{U}{U}, {4}{U}, or {6}.
2008/05/01: In a multiplayer game, compare the number of creatures you control with the number of creatures each other player controls. If any single player controls at least as many creatures as you, you get to put only one card into your hand.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: <Counterbore> has no effect on cards on the battlefield that have the same name as the targeted spell.
2008/05/01: The cards you're searching for must be found if they're in the graveyard, because that's a zone everyone can see. Finding those cards in the hand and library is optional, though.
2008/05/01: In most cases, <Counterbore> will exile the targeted spell. Its first sentence counters the spell, which puts it into its owner's graveyard. Its second sentence then removes it from the graveyard. However, there are some exceptions to this, as listed below.
2008/05/01: If the spell's controller isn't the same as its owner (due to Commandeer, for example), it won't be exiled. The spell is countered and put into its owner's graveyard. Then the spell's controller's graveyard, hand, and library are searched.
2008/05/01: If the targeted spell can't be countered (it's Vexing Shusher, for example), that spell will remain on the stack. <Counterbore> will continue to resolve. You still get to search for and exile all other cards with that name.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: The exiled card is played using the normal timing rules for its card type, as well as any other applicable restrictions such as "Cast [this card] only during combat." For example, you can't play the card during an opponent's turn unless it's an instant or has flash. Similarly, if the exiled card is a land, you can't play it if you've already played a land that turn. If it's a nonland card, you'll have to pay its mana cost. The only thing that's different is you're playing it from the Exile zone.
2008/05/01: If you don't play the exiled card that turn, it remains exiled but you can't play it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If <River Kelpie> and another permanent are each put onto the battlefield from a graveyard at the same time, <River Kelpie>'s first ability will trigger twice. (It will see the other permanent entering the battlefield.)
2008/05/01: If you cast another artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell from a graveyard, only the second ability triggers. That's because the card is put onto the stack, not onto the battlefield.
2008/05/01: If you cast <River Kelpie> itself from your graveyard (by using Yawgmoth's Will, for example), neither ability triggers. The first ability doesn't trigger because <River Kelpie> is put onto the stack; the second ability doesn't trigger because it works only while <River Kelpie> is already on the battlefield.
2008/05/01: If you play a land card from a graveyard (by using Crucible of Worlds, for example), only the first ability triggers. That's because the land (which isn't a spell) is put directly onto the battlefield from the graveyard.
2008/05/01: <River Kelpie> doesn't give you the ability to cast spells from graveyards. Its second ability merely triggers whenever a spell is cast this way (by using Memory Plunder, for example).
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: The effects of multiple <Thought Reflection>s are cumulative. For example, if you have three <Thought Reflection>s on the battlefield, you'll draw eight times the original number of cards.

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Beseech the Queen> is black even if you spend six red mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Beseech the Queen> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {B}{B}{B} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Beseech the Queen> by spending {B}{B}{B}, {2}{B}{B}, {4}{B}, or {6}.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: The amount of life a player may spend must be equal to or less than that player's life total; you can't spend life you haven't got.
2008/05/01: If a player chooses to spend life, their life total goes down immediately. This will affect how much life that player can spend the next time the process gets around to them. If a player chooses to pay life three different times during this process, for example, that counts as three separate instances of losing life, not as one.

<Artist>Daren Bader</Artist>
<Multiverseid>146761</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Artist>Terese Nielsen & Ron Spencer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>146762</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: When <Wound Reflection>'s ability resolves, it checks how much life each opponent lost over the course of the turn, then it causes that opponent to lose that much life. It doesn't matter how the opponent lost life or who caused it. It also doesn't matter if <Wound Reflection> wasn't on the battlefield at the time some or all of the life was lost.
2008/05/01: <Wound Reflection>'s ability checks only whether life was lost. It doesn't care whether life was also gained. For example, if an opponent lost 4 life and gained 6 life during the turn, that player will have a higher life total than they started the turn with — but <Wound Reflection>'s ability will still cause that player to lose 4 life.
2008/05/01: <Wound Reflection>'s ability triggers at the end of every turn. It doesn't have to be your turn, and it doesn't have to be the turn of an opponent that lost life.
2008/05/01: If <Wound Reflection>'s ability resolves, then an opponent loses life later in the same turn, that life loss is never counted by <Wound Reflection>.
2008/05/01: Multiple <Wound Reflection>s are cumulative. They'll both trigger at the same time. One will resolve first. When the second one resolves, it will see the same life loss that the first <Wound Reflection> saw, as well as the life loss caused by the first <Wound Reflection>. For example, if an opponent lost 3 life during the turn, the first <Wound Reflection> will cause that opponent to lose 3 more life, then the second <Wound Reflection> will cause that opponent to lose 6 life.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Flame Javelin> is red even if you spend six green mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Flame Javelin> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {R}{R}{R} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Flame Javelin> by spending {R}{R}{R}, {2}{R}{R}, {4}{R}, or {6}.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ralph Horsley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>152069</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Artist>Terese Nielsen & Ron Spencer</Artist>
<Multiverseid>146750</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: You're "tapping a permanent for mana" only if you're activating an activated ability of that permanent that includes the {T} symbol in its cost and produces mana as part of its effect.
2008/05/01: <Mana Reflection> affects any permanent you tap for mana, not just lands you tap for mana.
2008/05/01: <Mana Reflection> doesn't produce any mana itself. Rather, it causes permanents you tap for mana to produce more mana. (This is different than seemingly similar cards like Heartbeat of Spring and Gauntlet of Power.) If the permanent puts any restrictions or riders on the mana it produces, as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do, that will apply to all the mana it produces this way.
2008/05/01: <Mana Reflection> doesn't cause permanents you tap for mana to produce one extra mana — rather, it doubles the type and amount of mana that permanent would produce. For example, if you tap Mystic Gate for {W}{U}, it will produce {W}{W}{U}{U} instead.
2008/05/01: The effects of multiple <Mana Reflection>s are cumulative. For example, if you have three <Mana Reflection>s on the battlefield, you'll get eight times the original amount and type of mana.
2008/05/01: If you have <Mana Reflection> on the battlefield and tap a permanent for mana, but another replacement effect would change the type and/or amount of mana it would produce (such as Contamination, which says "If a land is tapped for mana, it produces {B} instead of any other type and amount"), you decide what order to apply those effects in. In this example, applying <Mana Reflection> first and Contamination second would result in {B}; applying Contamination first and <Mana Reflection> second would result in {B}{B}.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Multiverseid>158687</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the <Spawnwrithe> it's copying — or, if the <Spawnwrithe> whose ability triggered was itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the <Spawnwrithe>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Spawnwrithe>'s power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a <Spawnwrithe>. But if any copy effects have affected that <Spawnwrithe>, they're taken into account.
2008/05/01: If <Spawnwrithe>'s ability triggers, then <Spawnwrithe> becomes a copy of another creature before its ability resolves (due to Mirrorweave, perhaps), the token will be a copy of whatever creature the <Spawnwrithe> is currently a copy of. At the end of the turn, <Spawnwrithe> will revert back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is.
2008/05/01: If a copy effect such as Mirrorweave causes some other creature to become a copy of <Spawnwrithe>, then that creature deals combat damage to a player, the token that's put onto the battlefield is simply a copy of <Spawnwrithe>.
2008/05/01: A token created by a Cemetery Puca that's copying a <Spawnwrithe> will be a <Spawnwrithe> with the Cemetery Puca ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Tower Above> is green even if you spend six white mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Tower Above> has a converted mana cost of 6, even if you spend {G}{G}{G} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Tower Above> by spending {G}{G}{G}, {2}{G}{G}, {4}{G}, or {6}.
2008/05/01: When the creature affected by <Tower Above> attacks, you can target any creature on the battlefield with the triggered ability. However, if the creature you target can't block the creature affected by <Tower Above> (for example, because the attacking creature has flying and the other one doesn't, or because both creatures are controlled by the same player), the triggered ability does nothing. In that case, the creature you targeted is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: An effect that changes a permanent's colors overwrites all its old colors unless it specifically says "in addition to its other colors." For example, after Cerulean Wisps resolves, the affected creature will just be blue. It doesn't matter what colors it used to be (even if, for example, it used to be blue and black).
2008/05/01: Changing a permanent's color won't change its text. If you turn Wilt-Leaf Liege blue, it will still affect green creatures and white creatures.
2008/05/01: Colorless is not a color.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>151987</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>153973</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: Each other creature copies the printed values of the targeted creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to that creature. They won't copy other effects that have changed the targeted creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. They also won't copy counters on the targeted creature (they'll each just retain the counters they already have).
2008/05/01: If the targeted creature is itself copying a creature, each other creature will become whatever it's copying, as modified by that copy effect. For example, if you target a Cemetery Puca that's copying a Grizzly Bears (a 2/2 creature with no abilities), each other creature will become a Grizzly Bears with the Cemetery Puca ability.
2008/05/01: This effect can cause each other creature to stop being a creature. For example, if you target an animated Mutavault (a land with an activated ability that turns it into a creature), only the printed wording will be copied — the "becomes a creature" effect won't. Each other creature will become an unanimated Mutavault.
2008/05/01: Noncopy effects that have already applied to the other creatures will continue to apply to them. For example, if Giant Growth had given one of them +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then <Mirrorweave> made it a copy of Grizzly Bears, it will be a 5/5 Grizzly Bears.
2008/05/01: If the targeted creature is a token, each other creature copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Those creatures don't become tokens.
2008/05/01: As the turn ends, the other creatures revert to what they were before. If two <Mirrorweave>s are cast on the same turn, they'll both wear off at the same time.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>146754</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: The source of combat damage is the creature that deals it.
2008/05/01: If a spell is causing damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Burn Trail says "Burn Trail deals 3 damage to any target."
2008/05/01: If an ability is causing damage to be dealt, that ability will always identify the source of the damage. The ability itself is never the source. However, the source of the ability is often the source of the damage. For example, Knollspine Invocation's ability says "Knollspine Invocation deals X damage to any target."
2008/05/01: If the source of the damage is a permanent, <Swans of Bryn Argoll> checks who that permanent's controller is at the time that damage is prevented. If the permanent has left the battlefield by then, its last known information is used. If the source of the damage is a spell, its controller is obvious. If the source of the damage is a card from some other zone (such as a cycled Gempalm Incinerator), <Swans of Bryn Argoll> checks its owner rather than its controller.
2008/05/01: If a creature with wither would deal damage to <Swans of Bryn Argoll>, that damage is treated just like any other damage. It's prevented, and the creature's controller draws cards. <Swans of Bryn Argoll> doesn't get any -1/-1 counters.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: This effect has no duration. If you use the ability, <Cemetery Puca> will remain a copy of the creature until it leaves the battlefield or you use the ability again. If it becomes a copy of a different creature card, the new copy will overwrite the old copy.
2008/05/01: <Cemetery Puca> copies the printed values of the creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. It also won't copy counters on the creature (it'll just retain the counters it already has).
2008/05/01: If <Cemetery Puca> becomes a copy of a token, it copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. It does not become a token.
2008/05/01: <Cemetery Puca>'s ability isn't targeted. It can copy a creature with shroud or protection.
2008/05/01: If multiple creatures are put into their owners' graveyards at the same time, <Cemetery Puca>'s ability will trigger once for each of those creatures. You choose the order that those abilities will resolve. It's possible to pay {1}, have <Cemetery Puca> become a copy of something, activate an activated ability of that creature, then pay {1} again, for example. It will end up a copy of the last creature card paid for.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>141935</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

If the creature is blue or black at that time, the appropriate ability or abilities will trigger. They'll resolve even if the creature changes color or loses its Aura.

<Rulings>2008/05/01: An "unblocked creature" is a creature that attacked and wasn't blocked. Creatures aren't "blocked" or "unblocked" until the declare blockers step, so activating this ability before then (or after combat ends) will have no effect.
2008/05/01: Creatures stop being unblocked as the combat phase ends. However, they'll stay 4/1 until turn ends.
2008/05/01: <Inkfathom Witch> doesn't cause creatures to lose their abilities.
2008/05/01: If <Inkfathom Witch> is attacking and unblocked, it can make itself 4/1.
2009/10/01: The effect from the ability overwrites other effects that set power and/or toughness if and only if those effects existed before the ability resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves. Effects that switch the creature's power and toughness are always applied after any other power or toughness changing effects, including this one, regardless of the order in which they are created.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: Spells and abilities that would normally cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part simply has no effect.

2008/05/01: Effects that would replace gaining life with some other effect won't be able to do anything because it's impossible for players to gain life.
2008/05/01: Effects that replace an event with gaining life (like Words of Worship's effect does) will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2008/05/01: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number, and that number is higher than your current life total, that effect will normally cause you to gain life equal to the difference. With <Everlasting Torment> on the battlefield, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than your current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
2008/05/01: The "damage can't be prevented" statement overrides all forms of preventing damage, including protection abilities. Damage prevention spells and abilities can still be cast and played; they just don't do anything.
2008/05/01: Spells and abilities that replace or redirect damage aren't affected by <Everlasting Torment>'s second ability. They'll work as normal.

<Artist>Dave Allsop</Artist>
<Multiverseid>153298</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: <Murderous Redcap>'s power is checked at the time the ability resolves. If it's left the battlefield by then, its last known information is used.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Dave DeVries</Artist>
<Multiverseid>146736</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/05/01: The easiest way to choose a card at random from your graveyard is to turn your graveyard face down, shuffle it, and pick a card. You're not normally allowed to reorder your graveyard, but since this card lets you do it anyway, it's okay to mix the cards up while you're picking randomly.
2008/05/01: If you have multiple cards in your graveyard with the same name, and one of them is being targeted by another spell on the stack or enchanted (with Spellweaver Volute, for example), you must differentiate them so you know which one (if any) is chosen at random. In that case, it may be better to use dice to choose a card at random, or temporarily use a proxy card to represent the targeted card.
2008/05/01: Except for the card that you return to your hand, reordering your graveyard won't affect anything that's currently targeting or enchanting a card in your graveyard. Whatever it is will be able to track the card it's targeting or enchanting as your graveyard is reordered.
2008/05/01: All players get to see which card you chose at random.</Rulings>

A spell's total cost includes either its mana cost (printed in the upper right corner) or its alternative cost (such as flashback), as well as any additional costs (such as kicker). If it's something you can spend mana on, it's a cost. If that cost includes the {X} symbol in it, you can spend mana generated by Rosheen on that cost.

<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>147379</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: If a spell gains a second instance of conspire from Wort's ability, you may choose to pay for one, both, or none of those abilities. Each conspire ability triggers only if you tap two creatures specifically for that ability.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2017/03/14: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2017/03/14: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2017/03/14: Some spells instruct you to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast that spell. If you sacrifice Wort to pay that cost, that spell won't have conspire at the moment it becomes cast, so conspire won't trigger, even if you tapped two creatures.
2017/03/14: If you're casting a spell for its flashback cost, you can't pay another alternative cost (such as an overload cost or a Trap's alternative cost) instead. You may pay additional costs, such as conspire.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: Whether you choose to spend both {G} and {W} to cast <Dawnglow Infusion> has no bearing on the value of X. For example, say you decide that X is 4 and you'll spend {G} on {G/W}. If you end up spending {W}{W}{R}{R}{G} to pay the cost, X is still 4 and you've spent both {G} and {W}. You'll gain a total of 8 life.

If you regenerate a noncreature permanent, the next time that permanent would be destroyed that turn, instead tap it. If that permanent had any damage on it (because it had been a creature earlier in the turn), that damage is removed.
2008/05/01: Regenerating a planeswalker will prevent it from being destroyed as a result of a "destroy" effect (like the one from Reaper King). However, it won't prevent that planeswalker from being put into its owner's graveyard when its loyalty becomes 0.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: This ability doesn't overwrite any previous colors. Rather, it adds another color.
2008/05/01: The effects of multiple <Painter's Servant>s are cumulative.
2008/05/01: While <Painter's Servant> is on the battlefield, an effect that changes an object's colors will overwrite <Painter's Servant>'s effect. For example, casting Cerulean Wisps on a creature will turn it blue, regardless of the color chosen for <Painter's Servant>.
2008/05/01: Each card becomes a new object as it changes zones, so this effect will apply to it from scratch in the new zone. Zone-change replacement abilities that care about the new color (like "[color] permanents enter the battlefield tapped") won't work because those effects are applied as the card is entering its new zone. Zone-change triggered abilities that care about the new color (like "when a [color] permanent enters the battlefield" or "when you cast a [color] spell") will work because those effects apply after the card is already in its new zone.
2008/05/01: If something affected by <Painter's Servant> is normally colorless, it will simply be the new color. It won't be both the new color and colorless.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: If an effect reduces the cost to cast a spell by an amount of generic mana, it applies to a monocolored hybrid spell only if you've chosen a method of paying for it that includes generic mana.
2008/05/01: A card with a monocolored hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost is each of the colors that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. Thus, <Reaper King> is all colors even if you spend ten colorless mana to cast it.
2008/05/01: A card with monocolored hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost has a converted mana cost equal to the highest possible cost it could be cast for. Its converted mana cost never changes. Thus, <Reaper King> has a converted mana cost of 10, even if you spend {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} to cast it.
2008/05/01: If a cost includes more than one monocolored hybrid mana symbol, you can choose a different way to pay for each symbol. For example, you can pay for <Reaper King> by spending one mana of each color, {2} and one mana each of four different colors, {4} and one mana each of three different colors, {6} and one mana each of two different colors, {8} and one mana of any color, or {10}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/05/01: <Tatterkite>'s ability prevents any kind of counter from being placed on it, not just -1/-1 counters.
2008/05/01: A spell or ability whose effect would put a counter on <Tatterkite> simply doesn't affect it. The spell or ability isn't countered. If it would put counters on any other creatures, it continues to do so.
2008/05/01: If <Tatterkite> is dealt damage by a creature with wither, that damage has no effect. It's not prevented; it just doesn't do anything. Abilities that trigger on damage being dealt will still trigger.
2008/05/01: You can't pay a cost that includes putting a counter on <Tatterkite>. For example, if <Tatterkite> is the only creature you control, you can't cast Scarscale Ritual because you can't pay the additional cost.
2008/05/01: If <Tatterkite> would enter the battlefield with counters on it, it enters the battlefield but doesn't have those counters. For example, if an effect grants it persist and then it's destroyed, it returns to the battlefield without a -1/-1 counter on it.</Rulings>
