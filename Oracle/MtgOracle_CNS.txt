<CardText>Hidden agenda (Start the game with this conspiracy face down in the command zone and secretly choose a card name. You may turn this conspiracy face up any time and reveal that name.)
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell with the chosen name, you may copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Christopher Moeller</Artist>
<Multiverseid>382253</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/05/29: When the ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2014/05/29: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/05/29: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one â€”" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2014/05/29: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Skeletal Scrying has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2014/05/29: Effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell will be copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. For example, if a player exiles three cards from their graveyard to cast Skeletal Scrying, and you copy it, the copy will also cause you to draw three cards and lose 3 life (but you won't exile any cards from your graveyard).
2014/05/29: You must turn <Double Stroke> face up before you cast the spell with the chosen name to have <Double Stroke>'s second ability trigger.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players. Notably, you can't bluff conspiracies with hidden agenda by putting other cards into the command zone face down as the game starts.

2016/08/23: A conspiracy doesn't count as a card in your deck for purposes of meeting minimum deck size requirements. (In most drafts, the minimum deck size is 40 cards.)
2016/08/23: You don't have to play with any conspiracy you draft. However, you have only one opportunity to put conspiracies into the command zone, as the game begins. You can't put conspiracies into the command zone after this point.
2016/08/23: You can look at any player's face-up conspiracies at any time. You'll also know how many face-down conspiracies a player has in the command zone, although you won't know what they are.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy's static and triggered abilities function as long as that conspiracy is face-up in the command zone.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies are colorless, have no mana cost, and can't be cast as spells.
2016/08/23: Conspiracies aren't legal for any sanctioned Constructed format, but may be included in other Limited formats, such as Cube Draft.
2016/08/23: You name the card as the game begins, as you put the conspiracy into the command zone, not as you turn the face-down conspiracy face up.
2016/08/23: There are several ways to secretly name a card, including writing the name on a piece of paper that's kept with the face-down conspiracy. If you have multiple face-down conspiracies, you may name a different card for each one. It's important that each named card is clearly associated with only one of the conspiracies.
2016/08/23: You must name a Magic card. Notably, you can't name a token (except in the unusual case that a token's name matches the name of a card, such as Illusion).
2016/08/23: If you play multiple games after the draft, you can name a different card in each new game.
2016/08/23: As a special action, you may turn a face-down conspiracy face up. You may do so any time you have priority. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Once face up, the named card is revealed and the conspiracy's abilities will affect the game.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players.
2016/08/23: A conspiracy with hidden agenda that has a triggered ability must be face up before that ability's trigger condition is met in order for it to trigger. Turning it face up afterward won't have any effect.
2016/08/23: At the end of the game, you must reveal any face-down conspiracies you own in the command zone to all players. Notably, you can't bluff conspiracies with hidden agenda by putting other cards into the command zone face down as the game starts.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/05/29: The vote happens as the ability resolves. Until this happens, <Council Guardian> doesn't have protection from any color.

<Artist>Robbie Trevino</Artist>
<Multiverseid>382371</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/05/29: If duplication gets more votes, <Split Decision> creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2014/05/29: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/05/29: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one â€”" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2014/05/29: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Skeletal Scrying has), the copy will have the same value of X.
2014/05/29: Effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell will be copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. For example, if a player exiles three cards from their graveyard to cast Skeletal Scrying, and you copy it, the copy will also cause you to draw three cards and lose 3 life (but you won't exile any cards from your graveyard).
2014/05/29: Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.

2014/05/29: The ability of <Dack's Duplicate> doesn't target the creature.
2014/05/29: <Dack's Duplicate> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below), except it will have haste and dethrone. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2014/05/29: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Grenzo, Dungeon Warden), X is considered to be 0.
2014/05/29: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Dack's Duplicate>), then <Dack's Duplicate> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying. It will have haste and dethrone.
2014/05/29: If the chosen creature is a token, <Dack's Duplicate> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Dack's Duplicate> is not a token, even when copying one.
2014/05/29: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Dack's Duplicate> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.

2014/05/29: Dethrone doesn't trigger if the creature attacks a planeswalker, even if its controller has the most life.

<Rulings>2014/05/29: When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2014/05/29: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

2014/05/29: You cast the card before shuffling your library (if it was searched). In some very rare cases, you may need to take actions involving your library while casting the card. For example, if it has an additional cost and you activate Deranged Assistant's ability ("{T}, Put the top card of your library into your graveyard: Add {C}.") to pay for it, you must maintain the order of your library while you search it.</Rulings>

2014/05/29: If you accept a player's offer, the card you revealed becomes part of that player's card pool and the other offered card becomes part of your card pool.
2014/05/29: The cards exchanged this way aren't drafted. They can't be removed from the draft by Cogwork Grinder, for example.
2014/05/29: If either card involved in the exchange has any information noted for it, that information stays with the exchanged card, not the player who initially drafted it. Any abilities that refer to actions taken as you drafted the card (or similar) now refer to the card's new owner, even though that player wasn't the person who actually drafted the card.
2014/05/29: If a player exchanges a card that has multiple pieces of information noted for it, all of the information is shared during the exchange. For example, if you receive a Cogwork Tracker from a player who drafted multiple Cogwork Trackers, your Cogwork Trackers may attack any player noted by either you or the other player for Cogwork Tracker. The other player will not remove a noted player from their remaining Cogwork Tracker.

<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: If a token is exiled this way, it ceases to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: The exiled card will return to the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step even if <Glimmerpoint Stag> is no longer on the battlefield at that time.
2016/06/08: If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to a permanent with shroud, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled.
2016/06/08: If <Glimmerpoint Stag> somehow enters the battlefield during a turn's end step, the exiled card won't be returned to the battlefield until the beginning of the following turn's end step.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>382281</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The enchanted permanent will be both a land and a creature and can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
2010/03/01: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2010/03/01: An attacking or blocking creature that stops being a creature is removed from combat. This can happen if a Zendikon enchanting an attacking or blocking creature leaves the battlefield, for example. The permanent that was removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt combat damage. Any attacking creature that the land creature was blocking remains blocked, however.
2010/03/01: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature, this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness, such as the effects of Disfigure or Glorious Anthem, will continue to apply, no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon and the land it's enchanting are destroyed at the same time (due to Akroma's Vengeance, for example), the Zendikon's last ability will still trigger.
2010/03/01: If a Zendikon's last ability triggers, but the land card it refers to leaves the graveyard before it resolves, it will resolve but do nothing.</Rulings>

2009/02/01: Mountaincycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Mountaincycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Mountaincycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Mountaincycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Mountaincycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.

<Artist>Matt Cavotta</Artist>
<Multiverseid>382259</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Forestcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Forest card. After you find a Forest card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Any replacement effects are considered by <Reflecting Pool> when determining the types of mana a land can produce.
2004/10/04: Any change to a land's type or splicing of text into a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
2008/05/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag says "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you control Vivid Crag and <Reflecting Pool>, you can tap <Reflecting Pool> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do. It just cares about types of mana.
2008/05/01: Multiple <Reflecting Pool>s won't help each other produce mana. If you control a <Reflecting Pool>, and all other lands you control either lack mana abilities or are other <Reflecting Pool>s, you may still activate <Reflecting Pool>'s ability â€” it just won't produce any mana.</Rulings>
