<Multiverseid>6050</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you can choose that same permanent for more than one of the choices if you want to. This makes it possible to select an artifact creature as both your artifact and creature, and then select a land and thereby keep only two cards.
2004/10/04: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you can choose that permanent to be the representative of either type. This makes it possible to have more than one creature (or other permanent type) on the battlefield. For example, if you select a creature for your creature and an artifact creature for your artifact, you get to keep both of these creatures.
2004/10/04: The permanents to save are chosen on resolution. You do not choose them when casting the spell.
2004/10/04: The current player makes their choices before the other player. After both players make choices, all the sacrifices are done simultaneously.
2014/02/01: Each permanent not chosen by a player will be sacrificed. If a permanent has none of the listed types (for example, a Planeswalker with no other types), it can't be chosen.</Rulings>

2007/07/15: <High Ground> allows you to make some complicated blocks. For example, if you're being attacked by three creatures (call them A, B, and C) and you control three creatures (X, Y, and Z), you can have X block A and B, Y block B and C, and Z block just C, among many other possible options. The defending player chooses how each blocking creature's combat damage will be divided among the creatures it's blocking.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: At the beginning of the resolution, each player counts up the number of creatures they control, then they make the required number of payments and/or sacrifices. The active player announces their choices first followed by the other players, but all the sacrifices are done at the same time. Because of this, you can't sacrifice one creature in order to pay for another and thereby avoid payment for the first.
2004/10/04: You can choose to pay some mana and sacrifice some permanents if you have more than one creature.
2004/10/04: You can activate mana abilities during the resolution if you decide to pay mana.</Rulings>
