<ManaCost>3W (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>+1: Until end of turn, up to one target creature gets +1/+1 and gains first strike, vigilance, and lifelink.
-2: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control and a loyalty counter on each other planeswalker you control.
-7: You get an emblem with "If a source would deal damage to you or a planeswalker you control, prevent all but 1 of that damage."</CardText>
<Artist>Jae Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: You may activate the first ability with no targets. If you do, you simply put a loyalty counter on Ajani to pay the cost of the ability.
2014/07/18: If a permanent you control is both a creature and a planeswalker, Ajani's second ability will put both a +1/+1 counter and a loyalty counter on it.
2014/07/18: The emblem's ability doesn't consider who controls the source dealing damage to you or a planeswalker you control.
2014/07/18: Each attacking creature is a separate source of damage. For example, if two 3/3 creatures attack you and are unblocked, the emblem will prevent 2 damage from each creature. You'll be dealt a total of 2 damage.
2014/07/18: If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Dictate of the Twin Gods says, "If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead." Suppose you would be dealt 3 damage while Dictate of the Twin Gods is on the battlefield and you control Ajani's emblem. You can either (a) prevent all but 1 damage first and then let Dictate of the Twin Gods's effect double that, for a result of being dealt 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent all but 1 of that damage.</Rulings>

<CardText>+1: Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one of them into your graveyard.
-3: Return another target nonland permanent to its owner's hand.
-8: Each player shuffles their hand and graveyard into their library. You draw seven cards.</CardText>
<Artist>Jae Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: When the first ability resolves, the card you don't put into your graveyard stays on top of your library.
2014/07/18: If a player has no cards in their hand and no cards in their graveyard when the third ability resolves, that player won't shuffle their library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: A "creature card" is any card with the type creature, even if it has other types such as artifact, enchantment, or land. Older cards of type summon are also creature cards.</Rulings>

<Name>Chandra, Pyromaster</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra (Loyalty: 4)</Type>
<ManaCost>2RR (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>+1: Chandra, Pyromaster deals 1 damage to target player or planeswalker and 1 damage to up to one target creature that player or that planeswalker's controller controls. That creature can't block this turn.
0: Exile the top card of your library. You may play it this turn.
-7: Exile the top ten cards of your library. Choose an instant or sorcery card exiled this way and copy it three times. You may cast the copies without paying their mana costs.</CardText>
<Artist>Jae Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: To activate the first ability, you must target a player but you can choose to not target any creatures.
2014/07/18: If the first ability resolves but the damage is prevented or redirected, the target creature still won't be able to block that turn.
2014/07/18: The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Playing it follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2014/07/18: If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/07/18: In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
2014/07/18: While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
2014/07/18: While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
2014/07/18: Because you're casting the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/07/18: If the copied card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copies.</Rulings>

<CardText>+1: Target land you control becomes a 4/4 Elemental creature with trample. It's still a land.
+1: Untap up to four target Forests.
-7: Search your library for any number of basic land cards, put them onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library. Those lands become 4/4 Elemental creatures with trample. They're still lands.</CardText>
<Artist>Jae Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The type-changing effects of the first and third abilities don't have a duration. They last indefinitely.
2014/07/18: If the land targeted by the first ability entered the battlefield this turn, it won't be able to attack and its activated abilities with {T} in the cost (including its mana ability) can't be activated (unless something gives it haste). The same is true for the lands put onto the battlefield with the third ability.</Rulings>

-3: Destroy target creature. You gain life equal to its toughness.
-8: Target opponent gets an emblem with "Whenever a creature attacks you, it gets +5/+5 and gains trample until end of turn."</CardText>
<Artist>Jae Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: The first ability can target and destroy a Garruk planeswalker controlled by another player.
2014/07/18: If you activate the third ability, and the target creature is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't gain any life.
2014/07/18: The emblem's ability won't trigger if a creature attacks a planeswalker.
2014/07/18: The emblem is owned and controlled by the target of the ability that created it. In a multiplayer game, if Garruk's owner leaves the game, the emblem does not.</Rulings>
