<Rulings>2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
2014/04/26: The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. Strive abilities affect only what you pay.
2014/04/26: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.
2014/04/26: If such a spell is copied, and the effect that copies the spell allows a player to choose new targets for the copy, the number of targets can't be changed. The player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/04/26: If a spell or ability allows you to cast a strive spell without paying its mana cost, you must pay the additional costs for any targets beyond the first.</Rulings>

<Artist>Willian Murai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>380375</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Banishing Light>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Banishing Light> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the permanent when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield.
2014/04/26: If <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target nonland permanent won't be exiled.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2014/04/26: If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2014/04/26: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. <Banishing Light> and the returned card aren't on the battlefield at the same time.
2014/04/26: In a multiplayer game, if <Banishing Light>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

2014/04/26: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spellas as though they have flash will.
2014/04/26: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2014/04/26: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2014/04/26: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/04/26: You still control the Aura, even if it's enchanting a creature controlled by another player.
2014/04/26: If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield. Control of that permanent doesn't change; you'll control the resulting enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Similarly, if you cast an Aura spell with bestow targeting a creature controlled by another player, and that creature is an illegal target when the spell tries to resolve, it will finish resolving as an enchantment creature spell. It will enter the battlefield under your control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: A constellation ability triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. Enchantments with other card types, such as enchantment creatures, will also cause constellation abilities to trigger.
2014/04/26: An Aura spell without bestow that has an illegal target when it tries to resolve won't resolve and put into its owner's graveyard. It won't enter the battlefield and constellation abilities won't trigger. An Aura spell with bestow won't be countered this way. It will revert to being an enchantment creature and resolve, entering the battlefield and triggering constellation abilities.
2014/04/26: When an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, each constellation ability of permanents you control will trigger. You can put these abilities on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
2014/04/26: The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. Strive abilities affect only what you pay.
2014/04/26: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.

<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Battlefield Thaumaturge>'s first ability doesn't change that spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. It changes only the amount you actually pay (the "total cost" of the spell).
2014/04/26: To calculate the total cost of an instant or sorcery spell you're casting, start with the mana cost (or alternative cost, if applicable), add all cost increases (including additional costs such as those imposed by strive abilities), then subtract all cost reductions (such as the one created by <Battlefield Thaumaturge>'s first ability).
2014/04/26: The cost reduction created by <Battlefield Thaumaturge>'s first ability can reduce only the generic portion of the spell's total cost. Colored mana requirements aren't affected.

<Multiverseid>380393</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: The exchange of control lasts indefinitely. It doesn't expire when <Daring Thief> leaves the battlefield.
2014/04/26: Gaining control of an Aura or Equipment doesn't cause it to move, though gaining control of an Equipment will allow you to activate its equip ability to attach it to a creature you control later.
2014/04/26: The relevant card types (that is, the ones a permanent can have) are artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and tribal.
2014/04/26: If the full exchange can't happen, perhaps because one of the targets is illegal as the inspired ability tries to resolve, then nothing happens. No permanents change controllers.
2014/04/26: If another spell or ability allows you to change the targets of the ability (or perhaps copy it and choose new targets for the copy), you can change the targets only such that the final set of targets is still legal. For example, if the ability targets a creature you control and a creature an opponent controls, you couldn't change just the second target to a noncreature permanent controlled by that player. You could, however, change just the second target to a creature controlled by a different opponent. The two new targets can share a different card type than the two original targets did.
2014/04/26: Although the permanent you control can't be a land, the other target can, provided it shares a card type with the first target. For example, you could target an artifact you control and an artifact land controlled by an opponent.
2014/04/26: Inspired abilities trigger no matter how the creature becomes untapped: by the turn-based action at the beginning of the untap step or by a spell or ability.
2014/04/26: If an inspired ability triggers during your untap step, the ability will be put on the stack at the beginning of your upkeep. If the ability creates one or more token creatures, those creatures won't be able to attack that turn (unless they gain haste).
2014/04/26: Inspired abilities don't trigger when the creature enters the battlefield.
2014/04/26: If the inspired ability includes an optional cost, you decide whether to pay that cost as the ability resolves. You can do this even if the creature leaves the battlefield in response to the ability.</Rulings>

2014/04/26: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2014/04/26: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Barger</Artist>
<Multiverseid>380474</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: The creature that's copied isn't targeted by <Polymorphous Rush>. You choose that creature as the spell resolves. It can be one of the targeted creatures. A creature can become a copy of itself this way, though this usually won't have any noticeable effect.
2014/04/26: The target creatures copy the printed values of the chosen creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. They won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2014/04/26: If the creatures copy a creature that's copying a creature, they will become whatever the chosen creature is copying.
2014/04/26: This effect can cause the targets to stop being creatures. For example, if they each become a copy of a land that has become a creature, the effect that turned that land into a creature won't be copied. The targets will become noncreature lands.
2014/04/26: Effects that have already applied to the target creatures will continue to apply to them. For example, if Giant Growth had given one of those creatures +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then <Polymorphous Rush> makes it a copy of Pensive Minotaur (a 2/3 creature), it will become a 5/6 Pensive Minotaur.
2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.

<Rulings>2014/04/26: When the triggered ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creature they will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
2014/04/26: None of the opponents are targeted. An opponent with hexproof would still sacrifice a creature.
2014/04/26: If multiple creatures you control die at the same time, <Dictate of Erebos>'s triggered ability will trigger that many times.
2014/04/26: If you control more than one <Dictate of Erebos> and a creature you control dies, each of the triggered abilities will trigger. Each opponent will sacrifice a creature each time one of those abilities resolves.
2014/04/26: If you and an opponent each control a <Dictate of Erebos> and a creature dies, a chain reaction happens. First the ability of one player's <Dictate of Erebos> will trigger, causing each opponent to sacrifice a creature. That sacrifice causes the ability of the other player's <Dictate of Erebos> to trigger, and so on.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spellas as though they have flash will.
2014/04/26: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2014/04/26: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2014/04/26: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/04/26: You still control the Aura, even if it's enchanting a creature controlled by another player.
2014/04/26: If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield. Control of that permanent doesn't change; you'll control the resulting enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Similarly, if you cast an Aura spell with bestow targeting a creature controlled by another player, and that creature is an illegal target when the spell tries to resolve, it will finish resolving as an enchantment creature spell. It will enter the battlefield under your control.</Rulings>

2014/04/26: If an inspired ability triggers during your untap step, the ability will be put on the stack at the beginning of your upkeep. If the ability creates one or more token creatures, those creatures won't be able to attack that turn (unless they gain haste).
2014/04/26: Inspired abilities don't trigger when the creature enters the battlefield.

2014/04/26: You can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices—you can't do anything that player couldn't do. You can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the affected player would normally make (such as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. In other words, if the affected player wouldn't make a decision, you wouldn't make that decision on their behalf.
2014/04/26: You also can't make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
2014/04/26: You can use only the affected player's resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; you can't use your own. Similarly, you can use the affected player's resources only to pay that player's costs; you can't spend them on your costs.
2014/04/26: You only control the player. You don't control any of their permanents, spells, or abilities.
2014/04/26: If the target player skips their next turn, you'll control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
2014/04/26: Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
2014/04/26: You could gain control of yourself using <Worst Fears>, but unless you do so to overwrite someone else's player-controlling effect, this doesn't do anything.
2016/07/13: While controlling another player, you can see all cards in the game that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, and any cards in that player's library the player may look at.
2016/07/13: Controlling a player doesn't allow you to look at that player's sideboard. If an effect instructs that player to choose a card from outside the game, you can't have that player choose any card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Blinding Flare> can target any creature, including those you control.
2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
2014/04/26: The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. Strive abilities affect only what you pay.
2014/04/26: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.

The player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).

<Multiverseid>380403</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Dictate of the Twin Gods> applies to any damage, not just combat damage. It also doesn't matter who controls the source of the damage that's being dealt.
2014/04/26: The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, often the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will also specify the source of the damage, although the ability itself will never be that source. Often the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
2014/04/26: If more than one <Dictate of the Twin Gods> is on the battlefield, damage dealt will double for each one (two of them will end up multiplying the damage by four, three of them by eight, and four of them by sixteen).
2014/04/26: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, the ability of Decorated Griffin says "Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn." Suppose you would be dealt 3 combat damage and you activate the ability of Decorated Griffin. You can either (a) prevent 1 damage first and then let <Dictate of the Twin Gods>'s effect double the remaining 2 damage, for a result of being dealt 4 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent 1 damage, for a result of being dealt 5 damage.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>380456</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: The controller of <Mogis's Warhound> or the creature it's enchanting chooses which player or planeswalker to attack.
2014/04/26: If, during your declare attackers step, <Mogis's Warhound> (or the creature it enchants) is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under its controller's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2014/04/26: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spellas as though they have flash will.
2014/04/26: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2014/04/26: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2014/04/26: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/04/26: You still control the Aura, even if it's enchanting a creature controlled by another player.
2014/04/26: If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield. Control of that permanent doesn't change; you'll control the resulting enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Similarly, if you cast an Aura spell with bestow targeting a creature controlled by another player, and that creature is an illegal target when the spell tries to resolve, it will finish resolving as an enchantment creature spell. It will enter the battlefield under your control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
2014/04/26: The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. Strive abilities affect only what you pay.
2014/04/26: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.
2014/04/26: If such a spell is copied, and the effect that copies the spell allows a player to choose new targets for the copy, the number of targets can't be changed. The player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).

<CardText>Strive — This spell costs {2}{R} more to cast for each target beyond the first.
Choose any number of target creatures you control. For each of them, create a token that's a copy of that creature. Those tokens have haste. Exile them at the beginning of the next end step.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>380523</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: The tokens copy exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2014/04/26: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2014/04/26: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2014/04/26: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Twinflame> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put that token onto the battlefield.
2014/04/26: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2014/04/26: The tokens see each other enter the battlefield. If any of them have a triggered ability that triggers whenever a creature enters the battlefield, they'll trigger for one another.
2014/04/26: If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, that creature will have haste, but you won't exile it. However, if <Twinflame> creates multiple tokens copying a single creature due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you'll exile each of them.
2014/04/26: You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
2014/04/26: The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. Strive abilities affect only what you pay.

<Rulings>2014/04/26: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spellas as though they have flash will.
2014/04/26: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2014/04/26: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2014/04/26: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2014/04/26: You still control the Aura, even if it's enchanting a creature controlled by another player.
2014/04/26: If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield. Control of that permanent doesn't change; you'll control the resulting enchantment creature.
2014/04/26: Similarly, if you cast an Aura spell with bestow targeting a creature controlled by another player, and that creature is an illegal target when the spell tries to resolve, it will finish resolving as an enchantment creature spell. It will enter the battlefield under your control.</Rulings>

2014/04/26: The target opponent chooses whether to pay 3 life when Athreos's last ability resolves. You won't return the card to your hand if that player pays 3 life or if the card leaves the graveyard before the ability resolves.
2014/04/26: If there are no legal targets for Athreos's last ability (perhaps because each of your opponents has hexproof), it will be removed from the stack with no effect. No one may pay 3 life and you won't return the creature card to your hand.
2014/04/26: The type-changing ability that can make the God not be a creature functions only on the battlefield. It's always a creature card in other zones, regardless of your devotion to its color.
2014/04/26: If a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not, for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.
2014/04/26: If a God stops being a creature, it loses the type creature and all creature subtypes. It continues to be a legendary enchantment.
2014/04/26: The abilities of Gods function as long as they're on the battlefield, regardless of whether they're creatures.
2014/04/26: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat.
2014/04/26: If a God is dealt damage, then stops being a creature, then becomes a creature again later in the same turn, the damage will still be marked on it. This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)
2014/04/26: Your devotion to two colors is equal to the number of mana symbols that are the first color, the second color, or both colors among the mana costs of permanents you control. Specifically, a hybrid mana symbol counts only once toward your devotion to its two colors. For example, if the only nonland permanents you control are Pharika, God of Affliction and Golgari Guildmage (whose mana cost is {B/G}{B/G}), your devotion to black and green is four.
2014/04/26: Numeric mana symbols ({0}, {1}, and so on) in mana costs of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2014/04/26: Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color.
2014/04/26: Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s).</Rulings>

2014/04/26: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.
2014/04/26: If such a spell is copied, and the effect that copies the spell allows a player to choose new targets for the copy, the number of targets can't be changed. The player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2014/04/26: If a spell or ability allows you to cast a strive spell without paying its mana cost, you must pay the additional costs for any targets beyond the first.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: Iroas's last ability prevents all damage dealt to attacking creatures you control, not just combat damage.

2014/04/26: If a God enters the battlefield, your devotion to its color (including the mana symbols in the mana cost of the God itself) will determine if a creature entered the battlefield or not, for abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield.

2014/04/26: If a God is attacking or blocking and it stops being a creature, it will be removed from combat.
2014/04/26: If a God is dealt damage, then stops being a creature, then becomes a creature again later in the same turn, the damage will still be marked on it. This is also true for any effects that were affecting the God when it was originally a creature. (Note that in most cases, the damage marked on the God won't matter because it has indestructible.)
2014/04/26: Your devotion to two colors is equal to the number of mana symbols that are the first color, the second color, or both colors among the mana costs of permanents you control. Specifically, a hybrid mana symbol counts only once toward your devotion to its two colors. For example, if the only nonland permanents you control are Pharika, God of Affliction and Golgari Guildmage (whose mana cost is {B/G}{B/G}), your devotion to black and green is four.
