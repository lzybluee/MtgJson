<CardText>+2: Exile target permanent you own. Return it to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step.
-1: Creatures can't be blocked this turn.
-8: You get an emblem with "Whenever you cast a spell, exile target permanent."</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>266078</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Emblems behave similarly to enchantments: They have an ability that, in a general sense, continually affects the game. The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability.
2011/01/01: The first ability can target any permanent you own, including those another player controls.
2011/01/01: If the first ability exiles a token, that token will cease to exist. It won't return to the battlefield.
2011/01/01: A permanent exiled by the first ability will return to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step even if you no longer control Venser at that time.
2011/01/01: Venser's second ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. That's because the effect states a true thing about creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, all creatures can't be blocked that turn, including creatures you don't control, creatures that weren't on the battlefield at the time the ability resolved, and creatures that have lost all abilities.
2011/01/01: Venser's last ability creates an emblem with a triggered ability. The emblem is the source of the triggered ability. Because emblems are colorless, you can target permanents with protection from white or from blue, for example, with the triggered ability.
2011/01/01: Whenever you cast a spell, the emblem's ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it. It will resolve before the spell does.
2011/01/01: If you control more than one such emblem, each one's ability will trigger separately whenever you cast a spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: If <Oblivion Ring> leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted nonland permanent forever.
2007/10/01: If there are no nonland permanents on the battlefield other than an <Oblivion Ring>, and the card it exiled was another <Oblivion Ring>, casting a third <Oblivion Ring> will result in an involuntary infinite loop that will end the game in a draw (unless someone chooses to break it by putting another nonland permanent onto the battlefield or destroying one of the <Oblivion Ring>s, for example).
2008/10/01: If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything, but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled forever.
2012/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</Rulings>

2017/03/14: If the creature exiled with <Vanish into Memory> never returns to the battlefield (because it was a token creature, for example), you don't discard any cards.
2017/03/14: If the creature exiled with <Vanish into Memory> isn't a creature card (for example, a crewed Vehicle), that card will still be returned to the battlefield, but not as a creature. Since the card returned to the battlefield has no toughness, you discard no cards.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>266362</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Emblems behave similarly to enchantments: They have an ability that, in a general sense, continually affects the game. The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability.
2011/01/01: Koth's first ability can target any Mountain, including an untapped Mountain and/or a Mountain another player controls.
2011/01/01: If Koth's first ability animates a Mountain that came under your control that turn, it will have "summoning sickness" and be unable to attack. It will also be unable to be tapped to activate an ability with the {T} symbol in its cost, such as the Mountain's mana ability or the ability granted to it by Koth's emblem.
2011/01/01: Loyalty abilities can't be mana abilities. Koth's second ability uses the stack and can be countered or otherwise responded to. Like all loyalty abilities, it can be activated only once per turn, during your main phase, when the stack is empty, and only if no other loyalty abilities of this permanent have been activated this turn.
2011/01/01: Koth's emblem grants an activated ability to each Mountain you control at any given time for the rest of the game. It will continuously check which permanents you control are Mountains to determine what has the ability. For example, a Mountain that comes under your control later in the game will have the ability, while a Mountain you controlled at the time the emblem was created, but that later came under the control of another player, will no longer have the ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/02/01: When the third ability resolves, you must change the target if able. If you can't choose a legal target for the spell when this ability resolves, that spell's target doesn't change.
2007/02/01: If a spell targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Torchling>'s third ability, even if all but one of those targets has become illegal.
2007/02/01: If a spell has multiple targets, but it's targeting <Torchling> with all of them (such as Seeds of Strength targeting <Torchling> three times), you can target that spell with <Torchling>'s third ability. In that case, you change all of those targets to the same new target, as long as it meets each of the spell's targeting conditions.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>270828</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Mountaincycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Mountain card. After you find a Mountain card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Mountaincycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Mountaincycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Mountaincycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Mountaincycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Mountaincycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Mountain land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Mountain card in your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: Whether you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn is checked as this spell resolves, not as you cast it.
2010/03/01: Having more than one land enter the battlefield under your control this turn provides no additional benefit.
2010/03/01: The landfall ability checks for an action that has happened in the past. It doesn't matter if a land that entered the battlefield under your control previously in the turn is still on the battlefield, is still under your control, or is still a land.
2010/03/01: Once the spell resolves, having a land enter the battlefield under your control provides no further benefit.
2010/03/01: The effect of this spell's landfall ability replaces its normal effect. If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, only the landfall-based effect happens.
2010/03/01: You must choose two targets as you cast <Searing Blaze>: a player and a creature that player controls. If you can't (because there are no creatures on the battlefield, perhaps), then you can't cast the spell.
2010/03/01: If either target is illegal by the time <Searing Blaze> resolves, it still deals damage to the other target.</Rulings>
