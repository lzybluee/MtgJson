<Rulings>2004/10/04: Since you can respond to triggered abilities, it is legal to sacrifice creatures using some spell or ability prior to resolving the ability that removes the final counter from <All Hallow's Eve>.
2009/10/01: The only thing that happens when <All Hallow's Eve> resolves is that it's exiled with two scream counters on it.
2009/10/01: <All Hallow's Eve>'s triggered ability functions from the exile zone. This ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." It won't trigger at all unless <All Hallow's Eve> is exiled and has a scream counter on it (which can happen only if it resolves as a spell).
2009/10/01: Each creature returned to the battlefield by <All Hallow's Eve> enters the battlefield under its owner's control.</Rulings>

<CardText>If a player would draw a card except the first one they draw in their draw step each turn, that player discards a card instead. If the player discards a card this way, they draw a card. If the player doesn't discard a card this way, they put the top card of their library into their graveyard.</CardText>
<Artist>Heather Hudson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>1431</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The effect is cumulative. If there are two of these on the battlefield, each of them will modify each draw (after the first one if during the draw step), and will cause the player to discard or to "mill" a card from their library. As they resolve in order, the player must discard if possible. Once the player fails to discard and instead "mills" a card, all further effects of additional <Chains of Mephistopheles> will not do anything. This is because the "mill" also replaces the draw effect and the player is no longer drawing a card. You handle them in order. Each one makes you discard first and then continue or else mill a card and lose the draw.
2004/10/04: Cards which are drawn as a cost are affected by this card because replacement effects can alter the payment of costs.
2007/09/16: If a spell or ability would cause a player to draw multiple cards, this is treated as a number of individual "draw one card" actions. Apply the effect of <Chains of Mephistopheles> to each one.
2007/09/16: A player's normal card draw on their turn is exempt from this effect. All other draws will be affected.
2007/09/16: Here's what happens when <Chains of Mephistopheles> replaces a player's draw: — If that player has at least one card in their hand, they discard a card and then draws a card. — If that player's hand is empty, they put the top card of their library into their graveyard. The player doesn't draw a card at all.</Rulings>

It loses "enchant creature" and gains "At the beginning of that player's upkeep, Takklemaggot deals 1 damage to that player."</CardText>

<Multiverseid>1459</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If the creature leaves the battlefield without going to the graveyard, <Takklemaggot> is simply put into its owner's graveyard.
2008/05/01: <Takklemaggot>'s controller no longer changes as it returns to the battlefield. The player who controlled it when it left the battlefield is the same player that controls it when it returns to the battlefield, even though a different player may be choosing what it will be attached to after returning onto the battlefield.
2009/10/01: When the enchanted creature is put into a graveyard, <Takklemaggot>'s second ability triggers, then <Takklemaggot> is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. When the ability resolves, if <Takklemaggot> is still in that graveyard, it's returned to the battlefield.
2009/10/01: The player who controlled the creature that went to the graveyard (and caused <Takklemaggot>'s second ability to trigger) chooses what creature <Takklemaggot> will return to the battlefield attached to. The creature isn't chosen until the ability resolves, so no player can respond between the time the creature is chosen and the time <Takklemaggot> returns to the battlefield attached to it. The ability doesn't target a creature, so a creature with shroud, for example, can be chosen. However, only a creature that can be legally enchanted by <Takklemaggot> can be chosen, so a creature with protection from black, for example, can't be chosen. If the player can choose a creature, they must do so, no matter who controls it. If the player can't choose a creature, <Takklemaggot> returns to the battlefield as a non-Aura enchantment, and that player is the player that <Takklemaggot> will deal damage to.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: Any blocking creatures that regenerated during combat will have been removed from combat. Since such creatures are no longer in combat, they cannot be blocking <The Wretched>, which means you won't be able to gain control of them.
2009/05/01: If <The Wretched> itself regenerated during combat, then it will have been removed from combat. Since it is no longer in combat, there cannot be any creatures blocking it, which means you won't be able to gain control of any creatures.
2009/05/01: The ability grants you control of all creatures that are blocking it as the ability resolves. This will include any creatures that were put onto the battlefield blocking it.
2009/10/01: <The Wretched>'s ability triggers only if it's still on the battlefield when the end of combat step begins (after the combat damage step). For example, if it's blocked by a 7/7 creature and is destroyed, its ability won't trigger at all.
2009/10/01: If <The Wretched> leaves the battlefield, you no longer control it, so the duration of its control-change effect ends.
2009/10/01: If you lose control of <The Wretched> before its ability resolves, you won't gain control of the creatures blocking it at all.
2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the permanents you gained control of remain creatures, only that they remain on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: This effect applies no matter how the land would enter the battlefield: because an opponent plays it, or because a spell or ability allows that opponent to put it onto the battlefield. Note that it doesn't matter whose control the land enters the battlefield under. If the opponent would put the land onto the battlefield under someone else's control (as a result of Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example), that opponent will still have to sacrifice a land.
2009/10/01: If an opponent puts a land onto the battlefield under their own control, they may sacrifice that same land. The player won't be able to tap that land for mana before sacrificing it.
2009/10/01: If a land that would enter the battlefield has its own "If [this land] would enter the battlefield" replacement effect, the player who will control that land chooses which replacement effect to apply. After applying one, if the other one would still be applicable, it's then applied.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This effect modifies the announcement of an attack, so it only works if it is on the battlefield at that time.
2008/10/01: This has the supertype world. When a world permanent enters the battlefield, any world permanents that were already on the battlefield are put into their owners' graveyards. This is a state-based action called the "world rule." The new world permanent stays on the battlefield. If two world permanents enter the battlefield at the same time, they're both put into their owners' graveyards.
2009/10/01: <Arboria> doesn't stop creatures from attacking planeswalkers, regardless of what their controllers did or didn't do during their last turns.
2009/10/01: <Arboria>'s effect cares whether a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. It's unusual for an ability to care who did the putting (as opposed to whose control the permanent entered the battlefield under), and requires careful reading of spells and abilities to see which player is instructed to put something onto the battlefield. For example, Exhume causes each player to return a creature card from their graveyard to the battlefield. If Exhume's controller has no creature cards in their graveyard, but another player does, only that other player puts a permanent onto the battlefield. It doesn't matter who controls the effect.
2009/10/01: <Arboria>'s effect cares about the actions taken by players, not their results. If a player cast a spell during their last turn but that spell was countered, that player may still be attacked. The same is true if a player put a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield during their last turn, even if it's no longer on the battlefield by the time that player is attacked.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The cards are put onto the battlefield and will not trigger effects which trigger on such cards being "cast" or "played".
2004/10/04: In a game of N players, the process ends when all N players in sequence (starting with you) choose not to put a card onto the battlefield. It doesn't end the first time a player chooses not to put a card onto the battlefield. If a player chooses not to put a card onto the battlefield but the process continues, that player may put a card onto the battlefield the next time the process gets around to them.
2004/10/04: If the card has an X in its mana cost, treat X as zero.
2006/10/15: Anything that triggers during the resolution of this will wait to be put on the stack until everything is put onto the battlefield and resolution is complete. The player whose turn it is will put all of their triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
2007/09/16: A "permanent card" is a card that would be a permanent once it's on the battlefield. Specifically, it's an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: The creature card that will be returned to the battlefield isn't chosen until the delayed triggered ability resolves. The player who chooses is the player who controlled <Reincarnation>. The player under whose control the chosen creature card enters the battlefield is the player who owned the targeted creature (in other words, the player into whose graveyard it went), not necessarily the controller of that creature.
2009/10/01: The creature that's returned to the battlefield may be the same one that was put into the graveyard (assuming it's still in the graveyard when the delayed triggered ability resolves). If so, it returns to the battlefield as a brand-new creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: This has the supertype world. When a world permanent enters the battlefield, any world permanents that were already on the battlefield are put into their owners' graveyards. This is a state-based action called the "world rule." The new world permanent stays on the battlefield. If two world permanents enter the battlefield at the same time, they're both put into their owners' graveyards.
2009/10/01: If the player whose turn it is has four or more cards in their hand as <Storm World>'s ability resolves, the ability just won't do anything that turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: When <Divine Intervention>'s third ability resolves, the game ends immediately. The game is a draw, meaning neither player wins and neither player loses.
2009/10/01: <Divine Intervention>'s third ability triggers only if its controller removes the last intervention counter from it. It doesn't matter how that happens. For example, if you control <Divine Intervention> and the last intervention counter is removed as a result of a Clockspinning you control, the ability will trigger. On the other hand, if the last intervention counter is removed as a result of a Clockspinning another player controls, the ability won't trigger (and won't ever be able to).
2009/10/01: In a multiplayer game played with the limited range of influence option, <Divine Intervention> won't necessarily end the entire game when its third ability resolves. All players within range of <Divine Intervention> will leave the game. They'll neither win nor lose; as far as they're concerned, the result of the game is a draw. All other players will continue playing.</Rulings>

For example, if player A has 5 life and player B has 3 life before the exchange, player A will lose 2 life and player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2011/01/01: If an effect says that a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player who has a lower life total; in that case, the exchange won't happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: In multi-player games you can choose a different opposing player each time it is used.
2009/10/01: As you activate the ability, you choose an opponent, then that opponent chooses a creature for the ability to target. It doesn't have to be a creature that opponent controls. If there are no creatures that can be targeted with the ability, it can't be activated.
2009/10/01: As the ability resolves, you choose a damage source.
2009/10/01: The next time damage from the chosen source would be dealt to you this turn, that damage is dealt to the targeted creature instead. Whether it's still a legal target is not checked at this time. However, if it's not able to be dealt damage because it's neither a creature nor a planeswalker, or it's no longer on the battlefield, then the damage is not redirected and is dealt to you as normal.</Rulings>

If <Voodoo Doll> is no longer on the battlefield as the ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see if it was tapped or untapped.
2009/10/01: Each X in the cost of <Voodoo Doll>'s third ability is the number of pin counters on <Voodoo Doll> at the time you activate the ability.

If <Voodoo Doll> is no longer on the battlefield as the ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to see how many pin counters were on it.

<Rulings>2009/10/01: You apply power/toughness changing effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (a) effects from characteristic-defining abilities; (b) effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (c) effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (d) changes from counters; (e) effects that switch a creature's power and toughness. This card's effect is always applied in (b), which means that effects applied in sublayer (c), (d), or (e) will not be overwritten; they will be applied to the new value.
2009/10/01: Note that the duration of <Halfdane>'s ability is until the end of your next upkeep. If <Halfdane>'s ability doesn't get a chance to resolve (because there are no legal targets when it triggers, or because it's countered), then the effect from the previous turn's ability will continue to work through the rest of that upkeep step. Then that effect will wear off, and <Halfdane> will revert to being 3/3, its printed power and toughness (unless some other effect is modifying what its power and toughness is).</Rulings>

2009/10/01: The first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of your next upkeep. It doesn't matter who controls <Hazezon Tamar> at that time, or even if it's on the battlefield. The player who put Hazezon onto the battlefield gets the Sand Warriors.
2009/10/01: Only Sand Warriors that are actually on the battlefield when <Hazezon Tamar> leaves the battlefield are affected when its second ability resolves. If Hazezon leaves the battlefield after the delayed triggered ability created by its first ability triggers but before that ability resolves, its second ability triggers and resolves first, then the Sand Warriors are put on the battlefield. Those Sand Warriors will remain on the battlefield indefinitely.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Once the ability resolves, it doesn't care whether the targeted permanent remains a legal target for the ability, only that it's on the battlefield. The effect will continue to apply to it even if it gains shroud, stops being a creature, or would no longer be a legal target for any other reason.</Rulings>
