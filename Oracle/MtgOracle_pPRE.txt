<Artist>Christopher Rush</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

2013/07/01: Creature types, such as Human or Sliver, appear after the dash on the type line of creatures. Notably, artifact is not a creature type.

<Artist>Tomasz Jedruszek</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The number of targets you choose for <Comet Storm> is one more than the number of times it's kicked. First you declare how many times you're going to kick the spell (at the same time you declare the value of X), then you choose the targets accordingly, then you pay the costs. No player can respond between the time you declare how many times you'll kick the spell and the time you choose the targets.
2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want <Comet Storm> to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.

Flying, protection from colored spells, annihilator 6
When Emrakul is put into a graveyard from anywhere, its owner shuffles his or her graveyard into his or her library.</CardText>
<Artist>Justin Sweet</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before he or she declares blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of an attacking creature with annihilator chooses which of the defending players is affected by the ability. Only that player sacrifices permanents. The choice is made as the ability resolves; once a player is chosen, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2010/06/15: Emrakul can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Lay Bare). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2010/06/15: "Protection from colored spells" means that Emrakul can't be the target of colored spells (including colored Aura spells) or of abilities whose sources are colored spells (such as the "when you cast" ability of an Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre that's been turned red by Painter's Servant). It also means that all damage that would be dealt to Emrakul by colored spells is prevented. Like every protection ability, it works only while Emrakul is on the battlefield.
2010/06/15: "Colored spells" is not synonymous with "colored instants and sorceries." For example, if a player cycles Choking Tethers, its triggered ability may target Emrakul because Choking Tethers wasn't cast as a spell.
2010/06/15: Emrakul may be affected by colored spells that don't target it or deal damage to it, including those that cause it to become blocked. Abilities of colored permanents (such as Journey to Nowhere) may target it. Auras may be moved onto it by abilities or by colored spells that don't target it (such as Aura Graft).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2010/08/15: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2010/08/15: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2010/08/15: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

Whenever a +1/+1 counter is put on Fathom Mage, you may draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: <Fathom Mage>'s last ability will trigger whenever any +1/+1 counter is placed on it, not just ones due to the evolve ability.
2013/01/24: If multiple +1/+1 counters are placed on <Fathom Mage> simultaneously, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.
2013/01/24: If <Fathom Mage> enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it (perhaps due to Master Biomancer), its last ability will trigger once for each +1/+1 counter it entered the battlefield with.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Returning <Maze's End> to its owner's hand is part of the cost to activate its last ability. Once that ability is announced, players can't respond to it until after you've paid its activation cost and returned <Maze's End> to hand.

<Artist>Wesley Burt</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

When Nessian Wilds Ravager enters the battlefield, if tribute wasn't paid, you may have Nessian Wilds Ravager fight another target creature. (Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: If the opponent pays tribute, the creature will enter the battlefield with the specified number of +1/+1 counters on it. It won't enter the battlefield and then have the +1/+1 counters placed on it.
2014/02/01: The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
2014/02/01: If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.
2014/02/01: Players can't respond to the tribute decision before the creature enters the battlefield. That is, if the opponent doesn't pay tribute, the triggered ability will trigger before any player has a chance to remove the creature.
2014/02/01: The triggered ability will resolve even if the creature with tribute isn't on the battlefield at that time.
2017/04/18: For effects that check which player put counters on the entering creature, the player chosen to pay tribute puts those counters on it, not the creature's controller.</Rulings>

<Artist>Karla Ortiz</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: <Mercurial Pretender>'s ability doesn't target the chosen creature.
2014/07/18: The activated ability <Mercurial Pretender> gives itself becomes part of its copiable values. Unless the ability is overwritten by another copy effect, a creature that's a copy of <Mercurial Pretender> will have that ability.
2014/07/18: <Mercurial Pretender> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, etc. For example, if <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as a copy of a Profane Memento with Ensoul Artifact attached to it, <Mercurial Pretender> will be a noncreature Profane Memento with <Mercurial Pretender>'s added activated ability.
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Genesis Hydra), X is 0.
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Mercurial Pretender>), then <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying (plus any abilities it gained as part of the copying process, if applicable).
2014/07/18: If the chosen creature is a token, <Mercurial Pretender> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Mercurial Pretender> is not a token, even when copying one.
2014/07/18: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2014/07/18: If <Mercurial Pretender> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Mercurial Pretender> can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2014/07/18: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Mercurial Pretender> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Ryman</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Anafenza's first ability can target any tapped creature you control. That creature doesn't necessarily have to be attacking.
2014/09/20: While Anafenza is on the battlefield, abilities that trigger whenever a nontoken creature your opponent owns dies won't trigger, as that card will never reach that player's graveyard. (Token creatures will still go to the graveyard briefly before ceasing to exist.)
2014/09/20: If your opponent discards a creature card while Anafenza is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.
2014/09/20: Anafenza's last ability cares only what the card would be in the zone it's moving from, not what it would be in the graveyard. For example, if a land card you control becomes a creature due to an effect and then dies, the land card will be exiled. But if a creature card with bestow is an Aura when it would be put into the graveyard, it ends up in the graveyard.</Rulings>

Look at the top seven cards of your library. Put two of them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: The rules for delve have changed slightly since it was last in an expansion. Previously, delve reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under the current rules, you exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/09/20: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, Dead Drop's converted mana cost is 10 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2014/09/20: You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
2014/09/20: You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than nine cards from your graveyard to cast Dead Drop.

<Flavor>"We all want to know what's going on in someone else's head. I simply open it up and look."</Flavor>
<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

<Artist>Karl Kopinski</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: You decide whether to pay {2}{B} as the ability resolves.
2014/09/20: The creature card returned to the battlefield is chosen at random as the ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won't yet know what card will be returned.
2014/09/20: Because the ability doesn't target any creature card, any creature card (including <Kheru Lich Lord> itself) put into the graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to the battlefield.
2014/09/20: The ability that exiles the card at the beginning of your next end step is a delayed triggered ability. If the delayed triggered ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2014/09/20: <Kheru Lich Lord> grants flying, trample, and haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of your next end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2014/09/20: If a creature card returned to the battlefield with <Kheru Lich Lord> would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead. However, if that creature is already being exiled, then the replacement effect won't apply. If the spell or ability that exiles it later returns it to the battlefield (as Suspension Field might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The effects from <Kheru Lich Lord> will no longer apply to it.
2014/09/20: The exiled creature is never put into the graveyard. Any abilities the creature has that trigger when it dies won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Artist>Seb McKinnon</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: The rules for delve have changed slightly since it was last in an expansion. Previously, delve reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under the current rules, you exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/09/20: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, Dead Drop's converted mana cost is 10 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
2014/09/20: You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.

<Rulings>2014/09/20: Although turning a face-down creature with morph face up doesn't use the stack, <Rattleclaw Mystic>'s triggered ability does use the stack, and players can respond to that ability.

2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.

Morph {5}{U}{U} (You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for {3}. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)
When Thousand Winds is turned face up, return all other tapped creatures to their owners' hands.</CardText>
<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: It doesn't matter if <Thousand Winds> is tapped or untapped (or even on the battlefield) when its last ability resolves. Tapped creatures except <Thousand Winds> will be returned to their owners' hands.
2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

Ignore timing restrictions based on the cards' types. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2014/09/20: Because you're already casting the cards using an alternative cost (by casting them without paying their mana costs), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the cards, including casting them face down using the morph ability. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the cards have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2014/09/20: If a card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.

<Rulings>2014/11/24: The creature is the source of the new damage. If you control that creature as it deals damage, you may choose to redirect that damage from an opponent to a planeswalker he or she controls.
2014/11/24: The delayed triggered ability <Arcbond> creates will trigger even if the target creature is dealt lethal damage. For example, if a 3/3 creature is targeted by <Arcbond> and later in the turn it blocks a 7/7 creature, the 3/3 creature will deal 7 damage each other creature and each player.
2014/11/24: Damage dealt by the creature because of the ability <Arcbond> creates isn't combat damage, even if it was combat damage that caused the ability to trigger.
2014/11/24: If two <Arcbond>s have resolved targeting different creatures, and damage is dealt to one of them, the delayed triggered ability will cause that creature to deal damage to each other creature and player. This will cause the delayed triggered ability from the other <Arcbond> to trigger. The second creature will then deal damage to each other creature and player. This will continue until one or both of the creatures die or the game ends. If this doesn't happen (perhaps because both creatures have indestructible and damage dealt to the players is being prevented), and no player breaks the loop, the game will be a draw.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: You choose which opponent or opposing planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker <Flamerush Rider> is attacking.
2014/11/24: Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2014/11/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it doesn't copy any effects that may have turned a noncreature permanent into a creature. If the token isn't a creature as it enters the battlefield, it won't be attacking.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Flamerush Rider> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2014/11/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2014/11/24: If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, you won't exile that creature at end of combat. However, if <Flamerush Rider> creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you'll exile each of those tokens.
2014/11/24: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2014/11/24: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2014/11/24: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
2014/11/24: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.</Rulings>

<Name>Jeskai Infiltrator</Name>
<Type>Creature — Human Monk 2/3</Type>
<ManaCost>2U (3)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Jeskai Infiltrator can't be blocked as long as you control no other creatures.
When Jeskai Infiltrator deals combat damage to a player, exile it and the top card of your library in a face-down pile, shuffle that pile, then manifest those cards. (To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)</CardText>
<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The pile is shuffled to disguise from your opponents which manifested creature is which. After you manifest the cards, you can look at them.
2014/11/24: If <Jeskai Infiltrator> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, you'll manifest just the top card of your library.
2014/11/24: A card's owner is public information at all times. If the two cards you exile are owned by different players (perhaps because you gained control of a <Jeskai Infiltrator> owned by your opponent), which card is which is no longer hidden from your opponent. That player will know which face-down creature he or she owns.
2014/11/24: If you manifest a card owned by an opponent and you leave the game, that card is exiled.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Creature cards that have abilities that grant the listed keyword abilities to themselves won't count. For example, exiling a Battle Brawler (a creature with "As long as you control a red or white permanent, Battle Brawler gets +1/+0 and has first strike") with <Soulflayer>'s delve ability won't cause <Soulflayer> to have first strike, even if you control a red or white permanent.
2014/11/24: You can't exile more cards from your graveyard than you'd need to pay <Soulflayer>'s generic mana requirement. In most situations, this means you can't exile more than four cards, even if you want to exile more to give it extra abilities.
2014/11/24: You exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
2014/11/24: Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Tasigur's Cruelty (with mana cost {5}{B}) is 6 even if you exile three cards to cast it.

<Rulings>2014/11/24: "Defending player" refers to the player <Torrent Elemental> is attacking or the controller of the planeswalker <Torrent Elemental> is attacking. In multiplayer formats that allow attacking multiple players, creatures controlled by other players won't be tapped, even if you control other creatures attacking those players or planeswalkers those players control. In a Two-Headed Giant game, choose one member of the opposing team as the triggered ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Alexander Lee</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: Neither the first nor the second ability has a duration. If one of them resolves, it will remain in effect until <Warden of the First Tree> leaves the battlefield or some subsequent effect changes its characteristics.
2014/11/24: The first and second activated abilities cause <Warden of the First Tree> to lose any other creature types it has. It retains any card types or supertypes it may have.
2014/11/24: The first ability overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after the first ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2014/11/24: Effects that modify <Warden of the First Tree>'s power or toughness, such as the one created by Titanic Growth, will apply to <Warden of the First Tree> no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any +1/+1 counters on <Warden of the First Tree> and effects that switch its power and toughness.</Rulings>

<CardText>Manifest the top card of your library, then put X +1/+1 counters on it. (To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)</CardText>
<Flavor>A howl on the wind hides many dangers.</Flavor>
<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: If you choose 0 for X, you'll just manifest the top card of your library.
2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: The first mode won't affect life that was gained earlier in the turn.
2015/02/25: If you choose the third mode and put a land card onto the battlefield, that doesn't count as playing a land. For example, you can both play a land and put a land onto the battlefield this way during your turn.
2015/02/25: You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/02/25: You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren't chosen. For example, you can cast Ojutai's Command without targeting a creature spell provided you don't choose the third mode.
2015/02/25: As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of Ojutai's Command, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won't matter in most cases.)
2015/02/25: If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets for the copy, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/02/25: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: If there are no creature cards in the library, it will be revealed and shuffled. The target creature will remain exiled.
2015/02/25: Casting the card again due to the delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
2015/02/25: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered for any reason (either because of another spell or ability or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), that spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.
2015/02/25: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2015/02/25: As long as you cast a spell with rebound from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost or an alternative cost you were permitted to pay.
2015/02/25: If you cast a spell with rebound from any zone other than your hand (including your opponent's hand), rebound will have no effect.
2015/02/25: If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2015/02/25: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2015/02/25: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

The same is true for counters that change its power (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2015/02/25: If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.
2015/02/25: Some formidable abilities are activated abilities that require creatures you control to have total power 8 or greater. Once you activate these abilities, it doesn't matter what happens to the total power of creatures you control.

Such abilities check the total power of creatures you control twice: once at the appropriate time to see if the ability will trigger, and again as the ability tries to resolve. If, at that time, the total power of creatures you control is no longer 8 or greater, the ability will have no effect.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Ryman</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: Although most instants and sorceries that cause damage to be dealt are the sources of that damage, a few cause other objects to deal damage (for example, spells that cause creatures to fight). The first ability of <Dromoka's Command> won't prevent damage caused by those other sources.
2015/02/25: You can target any player with the second ability, including one that doesn't control an enchantment.
2015/02/25: You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/02/25: You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren't chosen. For example, you can cast Ojutai's Command without targeting a creature spell provided you don't choose the third mode.
2015/02/25: As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of Ojutai's Command, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won't matter in most cases.)
2015/02/25: If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets for the copy, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/02/25: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

2015/02/25: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs. You can pay additional costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

<Artist>Wesley Burt</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.
2015/02/25: Some formidable abilities are activated abilities that require creatures you control to have total power 8 or greater. Once you activate these abilities, it doesn't matter what happens to the total power of creatures you control.
2015/02/25: Other formidable abilities are triggered abilities with an "intervening 'if'" clause. Such abilities check the total power of creatures you control twice: once at the appropriate time to see if the ability will trigger, and again as the ability tries to resolve. If, at that time, the total power of creatures you control is no longer 8 or greater, the ability will have no effect.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/02/25: Once <Zurgo Bellstriker> has legally blocked a creature, raising that creature's power to 2 or greater won't undo the block.
2015/02/25: Even though both cards portray the same character, <Zurgo Bellstriker> and Zurgo Helmsmasher have different names. Controlling both of them won't invoke the "legend rule."
2015/02/25: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2015/02/25: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2015/02/25: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
2015/02/25: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: You may play that card that turn even if <Abbot of Keral Keep> is no longer on the battlefield or under your control.
2015/06/22: Playing the card exiled with <Abbot of Keral Keep>'s ability follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card by paying its mana cost only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2015/06/22: Unless an effect allows you to play additional lands that turn, you can play a land card exiled with <Abbot of Keral Keep>'s ability only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2015/06/22: If you don't play the card, it will remain exiled.
2015/06/22: Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
2015/06/22: Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
2015/06/22: Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: You choose one card name, not one name per opponent.
2015/06/22: Although spells with the chosen name can't be cast, permanent cards with that name can still be put onto the battlefield by a spell or ability.
2015/06/22: If your opponents have no nonland cards in their hands, you can't choose a card name. Alhammarret's last ability won't stop any spells from being cast in that case.

2015/06/22: The last sentence of <Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh>'s activated ability isn't a separate ability. The check happens only as that activated ability resolves. You must activate the ability in order to exile Chandra and return her to the battlefield transformed, even if Chandra has already dealt 3 or more damage during the turn.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.
2016/07/13: For more information on double-faced cards, see the Shadows over Innistrad mechanics article (http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-mechanics).
2017/09/29: You can control two of this permanent, one front-face up and the other back-face up, at the same time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: Hixus's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like Hixus have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield.
2015/06/22: If Hixus leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the creature that dealt combat damage to you won't be exiled.
2015/06/22: Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
2015/06/22: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/06/22: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/06/22: In a multiplayer game, if Hixus's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/06/22: The activated ability of <Jace, Vryn's Prodigy> checks to see if there are five or more cards in your graveyard after you discard a card. Putting a fifth card into your graveyard at other times won't cause Jace to be exiled, nor will Jace entering the battlefield while there are five or more cards in your graveyard.
2015/06/22: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face.
2015/06/22: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
2015/06/22: The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of Magic Origins, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
2015/06/22: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
2015/06/22: A Magic Origins planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
2015/06/22: In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/06/22: You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
2015/06/22: If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.
2016/04/08: If you discard a card with madness while resolving the ability of <Jace, Vryn's Prodigy>, you'll need to already have five other cards in your graveyard to satisfy that ability's condition. You can't choose to put the card directly into your graveyard to satisfy it.
2016/04/08: The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost equal to the converted mana cost of its front face. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color.

<Artist>Peter Mohrbacher</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: If the spell mastery ability applies, you'll cast the two cards in order. The one you cast last will be the one that resolves first.
2015/06/22: You cast the instant and/or sorcery card(s) from your opponent's library as <Talent of the Telepath> is resolving. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
2015/06/22: The cards will be put into their owner's graveyard after they resolve, not yours.
2015/06/22: If you can't cast any instant or sorcery cards (perhaps because there are no legal targets available) or if you choose not to cast one, then <Talent of the Telepath> finishes resolving. Any of the revealed cards you didn't cast will be put into that player's graveyard.

2015/06/22: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
2015/06/22: Check to see if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard as the spell resolves to determine whether the spell mastery ability applies. The spell itself won't count because it's still on the stack as you make this check.</Rulings>

If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If he or she doesn't, <Akoum Firebird> doesn't have to attack.

2015/08/25: Players can respond to the triggered ability, but once it starts resolving and you decide whether to pay {4}{R}{R}, it's too late for anyone to respond.

2015/08/25: If <Aligned Hedron Network> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no creatures will be exiled.
2015/08/25: Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
2015/08/25: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/08/25: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after <Aligned Hedron Network> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/08/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Aligned Hedron Network>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2015/08/25: In some very rare situations, <Aligned Hedron Network> may enter the battlefield as a creature with power 5 or greater. If this happens, <Aligned Hedron Network> will exile itself along with other creatures with power 5 or greater. Those cards will immediately return to the battlefield. If this causes a loop with <Aligned Hedron Network> continually exiling and returning itself, the game will be a draw unless a player breaks the loop somehow.</Rulings>

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by Anafenza, the Foremost), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
2015/08/25: Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile his or her hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use Wasteland Strangler to put one of those cards into his or her graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.

<Rulings>2015/08/25: If you cast the exiled card, you do so as part of the resolution of <Bring to Light>. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.
2015/08/25: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs, such as awaken costs. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those to cast the card.
2015/08/25: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X.

2015/08/25: If you don't cast the card, it remains exiled.
2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<CardText>When you cast Conduit of Ruin, you may search your library for a colorless creature card with converted mana cost 7 or greater, reveal it, then shuffle your library and put that card on top of it.
The first creature spell you cast each turn costs {2} less to cast.</CardText>
<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of any spell. It changes only the total cost you actually pay.
2015/08/25: <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability will look at the entire turn, even if <Conduit of Ruin> wasn't on the battlefield for some of it. Notably, if you cast <Conduit of Ruin> in a turn, then no other creature spell you cast that turn can be your first.
2015/08/25: <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability can't reduce the amount of colored mana you pay for a spell. It reduces only the generic component of that mana cost.
2015/08/25: If you control more than one <Conduit of Ruin>, the last ability of each of them applies only to the first creature spell you cast each turn, not to different spells; the first creature spell you cast each turn will cost {4} less.
2015/08/25: The first creature spell you cast each turn doesn't necessarily have to be the first spell you cast. You could cast a sorcery spell and then cast a creature spell that would get the discount.
2015/08/25: If there are additional costs to cast a spell, or if the cost to cast a spell is increased by an effect, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
2015/08/25: The cost reduction can apply to alternative costs (such as dash costs).
2015/08/25: If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has {X} in its mana cost, you choose the value of X before calculating the spell's total cost. For example, if the first creature spell you cast in a turn has a mana cost of {X}{G}, you could choose 2 as the value of X and pay {G} to cast the spell.
2015/08/25: If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has converge, you can't ignore the cost reduction of <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability in order to spend more colors of mana.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deckbuilding and game play.

2015/08/25: If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.

<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: A "nonland permanent card" is an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker card.
2015/08/25: If you return an Aura to the battlefield this way, you choose what it will enchant as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target any player or permanent, so you could attach an Aura to a permanent with hexproof controlled by an opponent, for example. If there's nothing the Aura can legally enchant, it stays in the graveyard.
2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Check the creature's power as <Exert Influence> resolves to see if it's less than or equal to the number of colors spent to cast <Exert Influence>. If it's greater, <Exert Influence> will finish resolving with no effect.
2015/08/25: Once you've gained control of a creature with <Exert Influence>, it doesn't matter what happens to its power. Raising it won't cause the control-changing effect to end.
2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: If the target card becomes illegal before the last ability resolves, it will be countered. You can't exile <Greenwarden of Murasa> in that case, even if you want to.</Rulings>

Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, tap target creature an opponent controls. If that land is an Island, that creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.</CardText>
<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: <Guardian of Tazeem>'s landfall ability can target a creature that's already tapped. If the land that caused it to trigger was an Island, that creature won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
2015/08/25: The ability tracks the creature, but not its controller. If the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step has come around, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

<Artist>Titus Lunter</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: A land that becomes a creature may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
2015/08/25: This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
2015/08/25: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2015/08/25: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if <Lumbering Falls> has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 6/6 creature that's still a land.</Rulings>

Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.

You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.

2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.

2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<CardText>Quarantine Field enters the battlefield with X isolation counters on it.
When Quarantine Field enters the battlefield, for each isolation counter on it, exile up to one target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Quarantine Field leaves the battlefield.</CardText>
<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: Use the number of isolation counters on <Quarantine Field> as its triggered ability is put on the stack to determine how many targets you may choose. Once the targets are chosen, the number of targets the ability has is locked in. Changing the number of isolation counters on <Quarantine Field> won't change how many nonland permanents are exiled.
2015/08/25: If <Quarantine Field> exiles multiple permanents, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
2015/08/25: If <Quarantine Field> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no permanents will be exiled.
2015/08/25: Auras attached to the exiled permanents will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanents will cease to exist.
2015/08/25: If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/08/25: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after <Quarantine Field> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/08/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Quarantine Field>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast <Radiant Flames> and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.

<Rulings>2015/08/25: You can cast a spell with awaken for its mana cost and get only its first effect. If you cast a spell for its awaken cost, you'll get both effects.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell will be countered if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.
2015/08/25: Awaken doesn't give the land you control a color. As most lands are colorless, in most cases the resulting land creature will also be colorless.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant. Activating the last ability more than once won't cause you to gain additional life if <Shambling Vent> deals damage.
2015/08/25: A land that becomes a creature may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
2015/08/25: This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
2015/08/25: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2015/08/25: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if <Shambling Vent> has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 5/6 creature that's still a land.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deckbuilding and game play.
2015/08/25: A card with devoid is just colorless. It's not colorless and the colors of mana in its mana cost.
2015/08/25: Other cards and abilities can give a card with devoid color. If that happens, it's just the new color, not that color and colorless.
2015/08/25: Devoid works in all zones, not just on the battlefield.
2015/08/25: If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.
2015/08/25: If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by Anafenza, the Foremost), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
2015/08/25: Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile his or her hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use <Wasteland Strangler> to put one of those cards into his or her graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<CardText>Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Zada, Hedron Grinder, copy that spell for each other creature you control that the spell could target. Each copy targets a different one of those creatures.</CardText>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: The ability triggers whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Zada and no other object or player.
2015/08/25: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has multiple targets, but it's targeting only Zada with all of them, Zada's ability will trigger. The copies will similarly each be targeting only one of your other creatures. You can't change any of the copy's targets to other creatures.
2015/08/25: Any creature you control that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by Zada's ability.
2015/08/25: You control all the copies. You choose the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and will resolve last.
2015/08/25: The copies that the ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Zada's ability itself) won't trigger.
2015/08/25: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2015/08/25: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Rolling Thunder does), the copies have the same value of X.
2015/08/25: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>
