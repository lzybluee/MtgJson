<Artist>Scott M. Fischer</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/08/01: None of these abilities has a duration. If one of them resolves, it will remain in effect until the game ends, <Figure of Destiny> leaves the battlefield, or some subsequent effect changes its characteristics, whichever comes first.
2008/08/01: <Figure of Destiny>'s abilities overwrite its power, toughness, and creature types. Typically, those abilities are activated in the order they appear on the card. However, if <Figure of Destiny> is an 8/8 Kithkin Spirit Warrior Avatar with flying and first strike, and you activate its first ability, it will become a 2/2 Kithkin Spirit that still has flying and first strike.
2008/08/01: You can activate <Figure of Destiny>'s second and third abilities regardless of what creature types it is. Each of those abilities checks <Figure of Destiny>'s creature types when that ability resolves. If <Figure of Destiny> isn't the appropriate creature type at that time, the ability does nothing.
2008/08/01: <Figure of Destiny>'s second ability checks whether it's a Spirit, and its third ability checks whether it's a Warrior. It doesn't matter how it became the appropriate creature type.
2009/10/01: The effect from the ability overwrites other effects that set power and/or toughness if and only if those effects existed before the ability resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves. Effects that switch the creature's power and toughness are always applied after any other power or toughness changing effects, including this one, regardless of the order in which they are created.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Paick</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle>'s triggered ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless, at the time a Mountain enters the battlefield under your control, you control five or more Mountains other than that new one, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you control fewer than five Mountains other than that new one by the time it resolves.
2009/10/01: If a Mountain you control leaves the battlefield between the time Valakut's second ability triggers and the time it resolves, be aware if that was the Mountain that caused Valakut's ability to trigger or not. If it was, Valakut's count isn't affected; if it wasn't, Valakut's count goes down by one.
2009/10/01: If multiple Mountains enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, Valakut's second ability could trigger that many times. Each ability takes into consideration the other Mountains that entered the battlefield at the same time as the one that caused it to trigger.

<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.
2010/06/15: The last ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step, before blockers are declared.
2010/06/15: In a multiplayer game, the only player affected by the last ability is the one <Lord of Shatterskull Pass> is attacking (or the one who controls the planeswalker <Lord of Shatterskull Pass> is attacking).
2010/06/15: If a level 6 <Lord of Shatterskull Pass> attacks in a Two-Headed Giant game, its controller chooses which one of the defending players is affected by its ability. The choice is made as the ability resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: <Steel Hellkite>'s last ability destroys only nonland permanents whose converted mana cost is exactly equal to X, and only those controlled by players who have been dealt combat damage by <Steel Hellkite> this turn.
2011/01/01: It doesn't matter who controlled those permanents at the time <Steel Hellkite> dealt combat damage, or if those permanents were even on the battlefield at that time.
2011/01/01: You may activate the last ability even if <Steel Hellkite> hasn't dealt combat damage to any players that turn. If you do, the ability won't do anything.
2011/01/01: If <Steel Hellkite>'s third ability is activated with X equal to 0, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0 the appropriate players control.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2011/01/01: If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying of something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jung Park</Artist>
<Rulings>2011/06/01: A card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in that mana cost, regardless of how that cost may have been paid.
2011/06/01: To calculate the converted mana cost of a card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, count each Phyrexian mana symbol as 1.
2011/06/01: As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.
2011/06/01: If you're at 1 life or less, you can't pay 2 life.
2011/06/01: Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.
2011/06/01: Except for also being an artifact, <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing more (unless that creature is itself copying something or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2011/06/01: If <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies a noncreature artifact, it is no longer a creature.
2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2011/06/01: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is a Clone), then your <Phyrexian Metamorph> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied, except it's also an artifact.
2011/06/01: If the chosen permanent is a token, <Phyrexian Metamorph> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, except it's also an artifact. <Phyrexian Metamorph> is not a token.
2011/06/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when <Phyrexian Metamorph> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this] enters the battlefield" or "[this] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2011/06/01: If <Phyrexian Metamorph> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent (due to Mass Polymorph or Liliana Vess's third ability, for example), <Phyrexian Metamorph> can't become a copy of that permanent. You may only choose a permanent that's already on the battlefield.
2011/06/01: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Phyrexian Metamorph> simply enters the battlefield as a 0/0 artifact creature and is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action (unless something else is raising its toughness).</Rulings>

Fuse (You may cast one or both halves of this card from your hand.)</CardText>
<Artist>Igor Kieryluk</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell is countered and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>

<CardText>Islandwalk (This creature can't be blocked as long as defending player controls an Island.)
Whenever Colossal Whale attacks, you may exile target creature defending player controls until Colossal Whale leaves the battlefield. (That creature returns under its owner's control.)</CardText>
<Artist>Erica Yang</Artist>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Colossal Whale>'s triggered ability triggers and resolves during the declare attackers step, before blocking creatures are declared.
2013/07/01: <Colossal Whale>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Colossal Whale> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield.
2013/07/01: If <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
2013/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
2013/07/01: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2013/07/01: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Colossal Whale> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Clone, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of <Colossal Whale>.
2013/07/01: In a multiplayer game, if <Colossal Whale>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: The controller of each attacking creature still chooses which player or planeswalker that creature attacks.
2013/09/15: If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/02/01: The defending player may block <Tromokratis> with each creature he or she controls. If that player can't, perhaps because one of those creatures is tapped, or chooses not to, <Tromokratis> can't be blocked.
2014/02/01: <Tromokratis> (like all attacking and blocking creatures) remains an attacking or blocking creature until the end of combat step is over. Notably, it will still be an attacking or blocking creature during the combat damage step, so any abilities an opponent controls that trigger when a creature dies as a result of combat damage could target <Tromokratis>.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Dictate of the Twin Gods> applies to any damage, not just combat damage. It also doesn't matter who controls the source of the damage that's being dealt.
2014/04/26: The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, often the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will also specify the source of the damage, although the ability itself will never be that source. Often the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
2014/04/26: If more than one <Dictate of the Twin Gods> is on the battlefield, damage dealt will double for each one (two of them will end up multiplying the damage by four, three of them by eight, and four of them by sixteen).
2014/04/26: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, the ability of Decorated Griffin says "Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn." Suppose you would be dealt 3 combat damage and you activate the ability of Decorated Griffin. You can either (a) prevent 1 damage first and then let <Dictate of the Twin Gods>'s effect double the remaining 2 damage, for a result of being dealt 4 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent 1 damage, for a result of being dealt 5 damage.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by Anafenza, the Foremost), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
2015/08/25: Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile his or her hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use Wasteland Strangler to put one of those cards into his or her graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.
2015/08/25: Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion creature token to add {C} to your mana pool is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/08/25: Some instants and sorceries that create Eldrazi Scions require targets. If all targets for such a spell have become illegal by the time that spell tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any Eldrazi Scions.</Rulings>
