<Rulings>2015/02/25: You choose the target of the first triggered ability as it goes on the stack, but you choose whether or not to fight as that ability resolves.
2015/02/25: If the target creature you don't control becomes an illegal target of the first triggered ability before it resolves, <Foe-Razer Regent> won't fight and its last ability won't trigger.
2015/02/25: If a creature you control fights during an end step, the delayed triggered ability that puts +1/+1 counters on that creature won't trigger until the beginning of the following turn's end step.</Rulings>
