When you cycle Decree of Justice, you may pay {X}. If you do, create X 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens.</CardText>
<Artist>Adam Rex</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2018/03/16: A mana cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {8}{W}{W} to cast <Decree of Justice>.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/06/14: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker or put onto the battlefield attacking during a turn's combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2019/06/14: If you cast <Wing Shards> after combat damage has been dealt, only creatures that survived combat can be sacrificed.
2019/06/14: <Wing Shards> doesn't target the creature to be sacrificed. The target player chooses the creature as it resolves.
2019/06/14: The copies storm creates are created on the stack, so they're not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as storm) won't trigger.
2019/06/14: Storm counts spells cast before the spell with storm was cast. Spells cast after the spell with storm was cast but before the storm ability resolves aren't counted.
2019/06/14: The storm ability and the copies it creates all resolve before the spell with storm. They resolve even if the spell with storm is countered.</Rulings>

<Artist>Luca Zontini</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The target of the ability can't be a creature with Protection from Creatures, with Protection from Goblins, or with Protection from Red.
2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: If unpreventable damage is applied to this card, you still remove a counter even though the prevention fails.
2004/10/04: Remove one counter each time it would be damaged. If it was going to take more than one point of damage, you prevent all the damage and still only remove one counter.
2004/10/04: The damage prevention ability works even if it has no counters, as long as some effect keeps its toughness above zero.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: If the copied spell requires a target and there are no legal targets, then the copy has the same target (which should be illegal) as the original.
2004/10/04: If the spell is countered before the triggered ability resolves, then the ability will make a copy of how the spell looked right before it was countered.
2004/10/04: It triggers once per spell, so you can't get multiple copies of a spell using this card. And since this card is legendary, you can't control more than one.
2004/10/04: The copy is not "cast" so it will not trigger anything that triggers on a spell being cast.
2004/10/04: You choose whether or not to pay when the triggered ability resolves.
2004/10/04: You are not required to choose new targets. If you do choose, then the targets must be legal. If you don't change them, the spell is placed on the stack whether or not the targets are legal. The legality of the targets is always checked on resolution of the spell, so the spell may be countered at that time if all of its targets are illegal.</Rulings>
