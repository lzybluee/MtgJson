Whenever you cast a spell, if it's the second creature spell you cast this turn, you may return Vengevine from your graveyard to the battlefield.</CardText>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: If you cast your second creature spell in a turn and <Vengevine> is in your graveyard, <Vengevine>'s second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of that spell. The ability will resolve, allowing you to return <Vengevine> to the battlefield before the creature spell resolves. The ability resolves even if that creature spell is countered.
2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability works only if <Vengevine> is already in your graveyard as you finish casting your second creature spell in a turn and if it remains there until the ability resolves.
2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability checks the spells you cast over the course of the entire turn, not just the ones you cast while <Vengevine> is in your graveyard. For example, if you cast a creature spell, then <Vengevine> is put into your graveyard, then you cast another creature spell, <Vengevine>'s ability triggers.
2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s ability triggers only for the second creature spell you cast in a turn. It won't trigger for the third, fourth, or so on. It also doesn't matter how many noncreature spells you cast in a turn; the ability counts only the creature spells.</Rulings>

<CardText>Hexproof (This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.)
Whenever Geist of Saint Traft attacks, create a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying that's tapped and attacking. Exile that token at end of combat.</CardText>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: You declare which player or planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker <Geist of Saint Traft> is attacking.
2011/09/22: Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2017/07/17: <Geist of Saint Traft> is banned as a commander in Duel Commander format, but it may be part of your deck.</Rulings>

2018/03/16: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.</Rulings>
