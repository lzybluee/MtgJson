That is, each creature you control with any +1/+1 counters on it can block an additional creature for each <Cenn's Tactician> you control. <Cenn's Tactician> doesn't care whether the creature has any +1/+1 counters on it beyond the first.</Rulings>

Each other Rogue creature you control enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.

<Rulings>2008/04/01: If a Rogue would normally enter the battlefield with a certain number of +1/+1 counters on it, it enters the battlefield with that many +1/+1 counters plus one on it instead. If a Rogue would normally enter the battlefield with no +1/+1 counters on it, it enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it instead.
2008/04/01: The creature gets the counter if it would enter the battlefield under your control. It doesn't matter who owns the creature or what zone it enters the battlefield from (such as your opponent's graveyard, for example).
2008/04/01: The effects from more than one of these cards are cumulative. That is, if you have two <Oona's Blackguard> on the battlefield, Rogue creatures you control enter the battlefield with two additional +1/+1 counters on them.
2008/04/01: If <Oona's Blackguard> enters the battlefield at the same time as another Rogue (due to Living End, for example), that creature doesn't get a +1/+1 counter.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/08/01: Each of the triggered abilities has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you control two or more lands of the appropriate land type when the Hedge-Mage enters the battlefield, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you don't control two or more lands of the appropriate land type by the time it resolves.
2008/08/01: Both abilities trigger at the same time. You can put them on the stack in any order.
2008/08/01: Each of the triggered abilities look at your lands individually. This means that if you only control two dual-lands of the appropriate types, both of the abilities will trigger.
2008/08/01: Both abilities are optional; you choose whether to use them when they resolve. If an ability has a target, you must choose a target even if you don't plan to use the ability.</Rulings>
