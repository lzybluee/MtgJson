<Type>Phenomenon</Type>
<CardText>When you encounter Morphic Tide, each player shuffles all permanents they own into their library, then reveals that many cards from the top of their library. Each player puts all artifact, creature, land, and planeswalker cards revealed this way onto the battlefield, then does the same for enchantment cards, then puts all cards revealed this way that weren't put onto the battlefield on the bottom of their library in any order. (Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)</CardText>
<Artist>Brandon Kitkouski</Artist>
<Multiverseid>226514</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/06/01: This ability is very similar to that of Warp World, but note that planeswalkers are put onto the battlefield.
2012/06/01: Taking it slowly, here's what happens when <Morphic Tide>'s ability resolves: 1) Each player counts the number of permanents they own. 2) Each player shuffles those permanents into their library. 3) Each player reveals cards from the top of their library equal to the number that player counted. 4) Each player puts all artifact, creature, land, and planeswalker cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. All of these cards enter the battlefield at the same time. 5) Each player puts all enchantment cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way can enchant an artifact, creature, land, or planeswalker that was already put onto the battlefield, but can't enchant an enchantment that's being put onto the battlefield at the same time as it. If multiple players have Auras to put onto the battlefield, the player whose turn it is announces what their Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all enchantments (both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time. 6) Each player puts all of their other revealed cards (instants, sorceries, and Auras that can't enchant anything) on the bottom of their library in any order.
2012/06/01: Cards such as Sakashima's Student that can enter the battlefield as a copy of another permanent won't be able to enter the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's entering the battlefield at the same time.
2012/06/01: After all permanents are put onto the battlefield and you planeswalk away from <Morphic Tide>, any abilities that triggered from those permanents entering the battlefield, from the previous generation of permanents leaving the battlefield, and from the new plane or phenomenon will be put onto the stack. You'll put all of your triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
2012/06/01: The permanents will enter the battlefield while <Morphic Tide> is face up. This means the game won't be on any plane when determining if any abilities trigger because those permanents entered the battlefield, for example. However, you'll planeswalk away from <Morphic Tide> before any such abilities are put on the stack. After you turn the next card of the planar deck face up, any abilities that triggered during the resolution of <Morphic Tide> (including any abilities that triggered because you encountered another phenomenon or planeswalked to the next plane) will be put on the stack. The planar controller will put their abilities on the stack in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. The last ability put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2012/06/01: Token permanents a player owns will count toward the number of cards that player reveals. They'll be shuffled into that player's library and subsequently cease to exist. A token's owner is the player under whose control it first entered the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/06/01: First, you may put a permanent card onto the battlefield, then each other player in turn order may do the same.

2012/06/01: This process is not repeated. Go around the table only once.
2012/06/01: After all permanents are put onto the battlefield and you planeswalk away from <Reality Shaping>, any abilities that triggered from those permanents entering the battlefield will be put onto the stack.

Whenever you roll {CHAOS}, reveal the top card of your library. You may play it without paying its mana cost.</CardText>
<Artist>Charles Urbach</Artist>
<Multiverseid>226518</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/06/01: You play the card (meaning it play it if it's a land card or cast it if it's a nonland card) as part of the resolution of the chaos ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," are not.
2012/06/01: If you reveal a land card when resolving the chaos ability, you may play it only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2012/06/01: If you cast a card without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as evoke or the alternative cost provided by the morph ability. If it has {X} in its mana cost, X must be 0. However, you can pay optional additional costs, such as kicker, and you must still pay mandatory additional costs, such as the one on Fling.</Rulings>

Whenever you roll {CHAOS}, until end of turn, whenever you tap a land for mana, add one mana of any type that land produced.</CardText>
<Artist>Martina Pilcerova</Artist>
<Multiverseid>226538</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/06/01: Effects that place a counter on a permanent include that permanent entering the battlefield. For example, a creature that normally enters the battlefield with one or more +1/+1 counters will enter with twice that many +1/+1 counters on it. A planeswalker will enter the battlefield with twice its starting loyalty counters.
2012/06/01: Adding loyalty counters to a planeswalker in order to activate a loyalty ability isn't an effect, so those counters are not doubled.
2012/06/01: Any -1/-1 counters that are placed on a creature because of wither or infect are also not doubled.
2012/06/01: The chaos ability is cumulative. For example, if you roll {CHAOS} twice in a turn, tapping a land for mana will cause two mana abilities to trigger.</Rulings>

<CardText>Any time you could cast a sorcery, you may exile a nonland card from your hand with X time counters on it, where X is its converted mana cost. If the exiled card doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. (At the beginning of its owner's upkeep, they remove a time counter. When the last is removed, the player casts it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it has haste.)
Whenever you roll {CHAOS}, remove two time counters from each suspended card you own.</CardText>

<Rulings>2012/06/01: Exiling a nonland card from your hand this way is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and doesn't count as casting a spell or activating an ability. Players can't respond to this action, although they can respond when you cast the spell after the last time counter is removed.
2012/06/01: The first ability may be used any number of times.
2012/06/01: Even after the game leaves <Talon Gates>, each of the suspended cards will continue to have suspend; the owners of those cards will continue to remove a time counter from each during their upkeeps.</Rulings>

<CardText>Instant and sorcery spells have rebound. (The spell's controller exiles the spell as it resolves if they cast it from their hand. At the beginning of that player's next upkeep, they may cast that card from exile without paying its mana cost.)
Whenever you roll {CHAOS}, you may search your library for an instant or sorcery card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Multiverseid>226529</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2012/06/01: Rebound's delayed triggered ability will let you cast the spell at the beginning of your next upkeep even if the game has left <Trail of the Mage-Rings> by then.
2013/04/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2013/04/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2013/04/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2013/04/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2013/04/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2013/04/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2013/04/15: Multiple instances of rebound on the same spell are redundant.
2013/04/15: The rebound effect is not optional. Each instant and sorcery spell you cast from your hand is exiled instead of being put into your graveyard as it resolves, whether you want it to be or not. Casting the spell during your next upkeep is optional, however.
2013/04/15: If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Arc Blade, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply.
2013/04/15: If a spell you cast from your hand has both rebound and buyback (and the buyback cost was paid), you choose which effect to apply as it resolves.
2013/04/15: You'll be able to cast a spell with flashback three times this way. First you can cast it from your hand. It will be exiled due to rebound as it resolves. Then you can cast it from exile due to rebound's delayed triggered ability. It will be put into your graveyard as it resolves. Then you can cast it from your graveyard due to flashback. It will be exiled due to flashback as it resolves.
2013/04/15: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand and it's exiled due to rebound, the delayed triggered ability will allow you to cast it during your next upkeep even if <Trail of the Mage-Rings> has been turned face down by then.
2013/04/15: If you cast a card from exile "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. Any X in the mana cost will be 0. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Momentous Fall does), you must pay those if you choose to cast the card.
2013/04/15: If a spell has restrictions on when it can be cast (for example, "Cast [this spell] only during the declare blockers step"), those restrictions may prevent you from casting it from exile during your upkeep.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell using the madness or suspend abilities, you're casting it from exile, not from your hand. Although those spells will have rebound, the ability won't have any effect.
2013/04/15: Similarly, if you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell with Commandeer, it will have rebound, but the ability won't do anything because that spell wasn't cast from your hand.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2012/06/01: You can only play the top cards of players' libraries when you are the planar controller. Generally, this means as long as it's your turn. When another player begins their turn, that player becomes the planar controller and can play the top card of players' libraries. You won't be able to until you again become the planar controller.
2012/06/01: You may play the top card of any player's library, including your own. This effect doesn't change when you can play any of these cards (meaning play it if it's a land card or cast it if it's a nonland card). You can still cast creature spells only on your turn during your main phase and so on.
2012/06/01: If the top card of a player's library is a land card, you may play it only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2012/06/01: As soon as you finish playing the card on top of a player's library, the next card in that library becomes revealed.
2012/06/01: If a player draws multiple cards at once, they reveal each one before drawing it.
2012/06/01: Other players won't be able to play the top card of their libraries unless another effect allows it. If you and another player can play the top card of that player's library (because of some other effect), you'll be able to in most cases. This is because you have priority first at the beginning of each phase and step and after each spell or ability resolves. Once you play that card, it immediately moves from that library to the appropriate zone (the battlefield if it's a land card or the stack if it's a nonland card). The other player can't respond by playing that card.</Rulings>
