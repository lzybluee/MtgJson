<CardText>Boseiju, Who Shelters All enters the battlefield tapped.

<Artist>Ralph Horsley</Artist>
<Multiverseid>291507</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/12/01: The spell can't be countered if the mana produced by Boseiju is spent to cover any cost of the spell, even an additional cost such as a splice cost. This is true even if you pay an additional cost while casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2004/12/01: Suppose mana produced by Boseiju is spent on a spell and an effect creates a copy of that spell. The copy can be countered, even though the original can't.</Rulings>

2017/04/18: <Desert> is a land subtype with no special meaning. It doesn't grant the land an intrinsic mana ability. Other cards may care about which lands are <Desert>s.</Rulings>

<Artist>Brad Rigney</Artist>
<Multiverseid>282542</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/05/01: Forest is a land type. Dryad is a creature type.
2007/05/01: <Dryad Arbor> is played as a land. It doesn't use the stack, it's not a spell, it can't be responded to, it has no mana cost, and it counts as your land play for the turn.
2007/05/01: If a <Dryad Arbor> gains flash, or you have the ability to play <Dryad Arbor> as though it had flash (due to Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir or Scout's Warning, for example), you can ignore the normal timing rules for playing a land, but not any other restrictions. You can't play <Dryad Arbor> during another player's turn, and you can't play <Dryad Arbor> if it's your turn and you've already played a land.
2011/09/22: If <Dryad Arbor> is changed into another basic land type (such as by Sea's Claim), it continues to be a creature and a Dryad.
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Maze of Ith> can target an untapped attacking creature. It will still prevent damage in that case.
2016/06/08: The creature isn't removed from combat; it just has its damage prevented. It's still an attacking creature until the combat phase is complete.
2016/06/08: You can activate <Maze of Ith>'s ability targeting an attacking creature you control during the combat damage step or the end of combat step. It'll be untapped and the damage it had already dealt won't be undone.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: <Murmuring Bosk> is a Forest, but it isn't a basic land. Things that affect basic lands don't affect it. Things that affect basic land types do. For example, you can't find <Murmuring Bosk> with Fertilid's ability ("searches their library for a basic land card"), but you can find <Murmuring Bosk> with Everbark Shaman's ability ("search your library for two Forest cards").</Rulings>

<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>287330</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: If <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> and either Blood Moon or Magus of the Moon are on the battlefield, all nonbasic lands will be Mountains, not Swamps. <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> will be a Mountain as well. It will have "{T}: Add {R}" and no other abilities.
2014/07/18: <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> isn't a Swamp while it's not on the battlefield.
2014/07/18: Urborg's ability causes each land on the battlefield to have the land type Swamp. Each land thus has the ability "{T}: Add {B}." Nothing else changes about those lands, including their names, other subtypes, other abilities, and whether they're legendary or basic.
2014/07/18: If Urborg loses its abilities (for example, if it becomes a creature and then Turn to Frog targets it), all lands on the battlefield, including Urborg, will still be Swamps, but Urborg won't have the ability "Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types." Urborg also won't be able to tap to produce {B}, but other lands (including those that enter the battlefield later in the turn) will. The way continuous effects work, Urborg's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes both the type-changing ability and its own mana ability.</Rulings>

2006/10/15: Cornered Market won't prevent <Vesuva> from being played (unless there's a <Vesuva> on the battlefield copying nothing), since you play it before it becomes named something else.
2018/04/27: If <Vesuva> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another land, <Vesuva> can't become a copy of that land. You may choose only a land that's already on the battlefield.</Rulings>

A creature that entered the battlefield attacking (such as a token created by Militia's Pride) doesn't count because you never attacked with it.</Rulings>
