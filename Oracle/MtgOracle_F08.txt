<Rulings>2013/06/07: The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.

2013/06/07: A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
2013/06/07: The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.

2016/06/08: You cast the copy while the ability is resolving and still on the stack.
2016/06/08: If the imprinted card leaves the exile zone while the activated ability is on the stack, the copy can't be made.
2016/06/08: If the exiled card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
2016/06/08: If you don't want to cast the copy, you can choose not to; the copy ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked.
2016/06/08: Because you're already casting the spell using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2017/04/18: The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by the combined mana cost of its two halves. When you activate the second ability, you may choose to cast either half of the split card, but you may not cast both halves.</Rulings>
