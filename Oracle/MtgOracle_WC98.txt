<Artist>Jim Nelson</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you can choose that same permanent for more than one of the choices if you want to. This makes it possible to select an artifact creature as both your artifact and creature, and then select a land and thereby keep only two cards.
2004/10/04: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you can choose that permanent to be the representative of either type. This makes it possible to have more than one creature (or other permanent type) on the battlefield. For example, if you select a creature for your creature and an artifact creature for your artifact, you get to keep both of these creatures.
2004/10/04: The permanents to save are chosen on resolution. You do not choose them when casting the spell.
2004/10/04: The current player makes their choices before the other player. After both players make choices, all the sacrifices are done simultaneously.
2014/02/01: Each permanent not chosen by a player will be sacrificed. If a permanent has none of the listed types (for example, a Planeswalker with no other types), it can't be chosen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: The decision to counter a spell or destroy a permanent is a decision made on announcement before the target is selected. If the spell is redirected, this mode can't be changed, so only targets of the selected type are valid.
2016/06/08: <Hydroblast> can target any spell or permanent, not just a red one. It checks the color of the target only on resolution.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/03/16: If you control more than one <Mogg Flunkies>, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
2018/03/16: Although <Mogg Flunkies> can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, <Mogg Flunkies> could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that <Mogg Flunkies> blocks.
2018/03/16: Once <Mogg Flunkies> has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
2018/03/16: If an effect says that <Mogg Flunkies> attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with <Mogg Flunkies> and that creature.
2018/03/16: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Mogg Flunkies> can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.</Rulings>

<Artist>Adam Rex</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: Any replacement effects are considered by <Reflecting Pool> when determining the types of mana a land can produce.
2004/10/04: Any change to a land's type or splicing of text into a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
2008/05/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag says "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you control Vivid Crag and <Reflecting Pool>, you can tap <Reflecting Pool> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2008/05/01: <Reflecting Pool> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as Pillar of the Paruns and Hall of the Bandit Lord do. It just cares about types of mana.
2008/05/01: Multiple <Reflecting Pool>s won't help each other produce mana. If you control a <Reflecting Pool>, and all other lands you control either lack mana abilities or are other <Reflecting Pool>s, you may still activate <Reflecting Pool>'s ability — it just won't produce any mana.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.</Rulings>
