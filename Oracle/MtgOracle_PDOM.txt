<Artist>Sidharth Chaturvedi</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: A card, spell, or permanent is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make an object more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—an object either is historic or it isn't.
2018/04/27: Some abilities trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell." Such an ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/04/27: An ability that triggers "whenever you cast a historic spell" doesn't trigger if a historic card is put onto the battlefield without being cast.
2018/04/27: Lands are never cast, so abilities that trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell" won't trigger if you play a legendary land. They also won't trigger if a card on the battlefield transforms into a legendary land, as the Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan double-faced cards do.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If Evra isn't on the battlefield when its activated ability resolves, the exchange can't happen and the ability will have no effect. However, if Evra is on the battlefield but has power 0 or less, the exchange happens and you'll lose the game.
2018/04/27: When its activated ability resolves, Evra's power will become your former life total and you will gain or lose an amount of life such that your life total equals Evra's former power. Other effects that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2018/04/27: Any power-modifying effects, counters, Auras, or Equipment will apply after Evra's power is set to your former life total. For example, say Evra is enchanted with Dub (which makes it 6/6) and your life total is 7. After the exchange, Evra would be a 9/6 creature (its power became 7, which was then modified by Dub) and your life total would be 6.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If a player somehow has only one land card in their graveyard when either of <Fall of the Thran>'s last two chapter abilities resolves, that player returns that one card to the battlefield.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: The final chapter ability of <The Antiquities War> affects only artifacts you control at the time it resolves. Artifacts you begin to control later in the turn won't become 5/5 creatures.
2018/04/27: The final chapter ability of <The Antiquities War> overwrites an artifact creature's normal base power and toughness and all previous effects that set an artifact creature's base power and toughness to specific values.

2018/04/27: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2018/04/27: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/04/27: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/04/27: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Jaya's Immolating Inferno does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/04/27: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fight with Fire does when kicked), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/04/27: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability.

2018/04/27: Naban's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.
2018/04/27: The trigger event doesn't have to specifically refer to "Wizards." For example, an ability that triggers "whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control" would trigger twice if the entering creature is a Wizard.
2018/04/27: Look at each permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger multiple times. For example, if you control Arcane Adaptation with Wizard as the chosen creature type, a Runeclaw Bear entering the battlefield will cause any abilities it triggers to trigger an additional time.
2018/04/27: If you somehow control two Nabans, a Wizard entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Naban causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
2018/04/27: If a Wizard entering the battlefield at the same time as Naban (including Naban itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
2018/04/27: If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.
2018/04/27: In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.</Rulings>

When Naru Meha, Master Wizard enters the battlefield, copy target instant or sorcery spell you control. You may choose new targets for the copy.
Other Wizards you control get +1/+1.</CardText>
<Artist>Matt Stewart</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a Wizard you control may become lethal if Naru leaves the battlefield during that turn.
2018/04/27: Naru's triggered ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2018/04/27: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2018/04/27: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2018/04/27: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2018/04/27: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Jaya's Immolating Inferno does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2018/04/27: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fight with Fire does when kicked), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
2018/04/27: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: <Precognition Field> lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
2018/04/27: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
2018/04/27: You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of the cards you play from your library.

2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.

<CardText>(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
I — The First Eruption deals 1 damage to each creature without flying.
II — Add {R}{R}.
III — Sacrifice a Mountain. If you do, The First Eruption deals 3 damage to each creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: While resolving <The First Eruption>'s final chapter ability, you must sacrifice one Mountain if able. You can't sacrifice multiple Mountains to deal more damage.
2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered. This state-based action doesn't use the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: The nonenchantment permanents that receive aim counters aren't targeted. Permanents with hexproof can be given an aim counter this way.
2018/04/27: Aim counters are interchangeable.

2018/04/27: Players can't take actions between the time the permanent is randomly selected and the time it's destroyed. Notably, if a land is randomly selected, it can't be tapped for mana before being destroyed.

<Rulings>2018/04/27: If an effect instructs you to "double" a creature's power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is its power as that effect begins to apply. The same is true for its toughness.
2018/04/27: If a creature's power is less than 0 when it's doubled, instead that creature gets -X/-0, where X is how much less than 0 its power is. For example, if an effect has given Grunn -7/-0 so that it's a -2/5 creature, doubling its power and toughness gives it -2/+5, and it's a -4/10 until end of turn.
2018/04/27: A creature attacks alone if it's the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step (including creatures controlled by your teammates, if applicable).

<Artist>Adam Paquette</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As your precombat main phase begins (immediately after your draw step), you put another lore counter on each Saga you control. Putting a lore counter on a Saga in either of these ways doesn't use the stack.
2018/04/27: Each symbol on the left of a Saga's text box represents a chapter ability. A chapter ability is a triggered ability that triggers when a lore counter that is put on the Saga causes the number of lore counters on the Saga to become equal to or greater than the ability's chapter number. Chapter abilities are put onto the stack and may be responded to.
2018/04/27: A chapter ability doesn't trigger if a lore counter is put on a Saga that already had a number of lore counters greater than or equal to that chapter's number. For example, the third lore counter put on a Saga causes the III chapter ability to trigger, but I and II won't trigger again.
2018/04/27: Once a chapter ability has triggered, the ability on the stack won't be affected if the Saga gains or loses counters, or if it leaves the battlefield.
2018/04/27: If multiple chapter abilities trigger at the same time, their controller puts them on the stack in any order. If any of them require targets, those targets are chosen as you put the abilities on the stack, before any of those abilities resolve.
2018/04/27: If counters are removed from a Saga, the appropriate chapter abilities will trigger again when the Saga receives lore counters. Removing lore counters won't cause a previous chapter ability to trigger.
2018/04/27: Once the number of lore counters on a Saga is greater than or equal to the greatest number among its chapter abilities—in the Dominaria set, this is always three—the Saga's controller sacrifices it as soon as its chapter ability has left the stack, most likely by resolving or being countered.

2018/04/27: You can tap any untapped Knights you control, including ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, to pay the cost of Aryel's last ability. However, you must have controlled Aryel continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn in order to use either of its activated abilities.
2018/04/27: Once you announce that you're activating Aryel's last ability, no player may take other actions until the ability's been paid for. Notably, players can't try to make the value of X invalid by removing or tapping your Knights.
2018/04/27: If the target creature's power is greater than X as Aryel's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You can't tap extra Knights once the ability has been activated.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/04/27: A card, spell, or permanent is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make an object more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—an object either is historic or it isn't.

2018/04/27: An ability that triggers "whenever you cast a historic spell" doesn't trigger if a historic card is put onto the battlefield without being cast.

2018/04/27: If the copied creature is a token, the token that's created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created that token.
2018/04/27: If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2018/04/27: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2018/04/27: If the equipped creature leaves the battlefield before the triggered ability of <Helm of the Host> resolves, or if there is no equipped creature, no token is created. However, if <Helm of the Host> leaves the battlefield while its triggered ability is on the stack, a token will be created of the creature it last equipped. If that creature has also left the battlefield, its last known information is used to determine what the token looks like.</Rulings>

<Type>Artifact Creature — Assembly-Worker 2/2</Type>
<ManaCost>5 (5)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Whenever you cast a historic spell, you may pay {1}. If you do, create a token that's a copy of Mishra's Self-Replicator. (Artifacts, legendaries, and Sagas are historic.)</CardText>
<Flavor>It has witnessed history's most significant events, one incarnation after another.</Flavor>
<Artist>Joseph Meehan</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/04/27: The token will have <Mishra's Self-Replicator>'s ability. It will also be able to create copies of itself.
2018/04/27: While resolving the triggered ability of <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, you can't pay {1} multiple times to create more than one token. However, if you control more than one <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, you can pay {1} for each of their abilities.
2018/04/27: The token won't copy counters or damage marked on <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Mishra's Self-Replicator>'s power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, but if any copy effects have affected that <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, they're taken into account.
2018/04/27: If <Mishra's Self-Replicator> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the token will still enter the battlefield as a copy of <Mishra's Self-Replicator>, using <Mishra's Self-Replicator>'s copiable values from when it was last on the battlefield.
2018/04/27: A card, spell, or permanent is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make an object more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—an object either is historic or it isn't.
2018/04/27: Some abilities trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell." Such an ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/04/27: An ability that triggers "whenever you cast a historic spell" doesn't trigger if a historic card is put onto the battlefield without being cast.
2018/04/27: Lands are never cast, so abilities that trigger "whenever you cast a historic spell" won't trigger if you play a legendary land. They also won't trigger if a card on the battlefield transforms into a legendary land, as the Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan double-faced cards do.</Rulings>
