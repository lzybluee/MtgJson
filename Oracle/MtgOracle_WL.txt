<Rulings>2008/04/01: The "top" card of your graveyard is the card that was put there most recently.
2008/04/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards. This is a little-known rule because new cards that care about graveyard order haven't been printed in years.
2008/04/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/04/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. —Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/04/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.
2008/04/01: When the ability resolves, you choose whether to sacrifice the creature or perform the other action. If you can't perform the other action, then you must sacrifice the creature.

<Rulings>2008/04/01: The "top" card of your graveyard is the card that was put there most recently.
2008/04/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards. This is a little-known rule because new cards that care about graveyard order haven't been printed in years.
2008/04/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/04/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. —Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/04/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ted Naifeh</Artist>
<Multiverseid>4511</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: <Choking Vines> will make any creatures it targets become blocked, even if the creature had blocking restrictions on it. For example, you can make a creature with Islandwalk become blocked even if the defending player has Islands. This is because evasion abilities only prevent creatures from being assigned to block them.
2004/10/04: You can declare zero targets, with X=0.
2008/04/01: <Choking Vines> isn't particularly effective against creatures with trample. Since the creature with trample has no blocker to assign damage to, all the damage will be assigned to the defending player.
2008/04/01: You may target a blocked creature with <Choking Vines>. <Choking Vines> will deal 1 damage to it, and have no other effect on it.
2008/04/01: If a previously unblocked creature becomes blocked as a result of <Choking Vines>, any "When this creature becomes blocked" abilities that creature has will trigger. Any "When this creature becomes blocked by a creature" abilities that creature has won't trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: The "top" card of your graveyard is the card that was put there most recently.
2008/04/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards. This is a little-known rule because new cards that care about graveyard order haven't been printed in years.
2008/04/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/04/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. —Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/04/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

2008/04/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. —Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/04/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: Casting <Debt of Loyalty> puts a regeneration shield on a creature. If, later in the turn, that creature would be destroyed, instead it regenerates and you gain control of it. Note that it will be tapped when you gain control of it. The control change has no duration; you'll retain control of that creature until the game ends or until some other effect causes it to change control.
2008/04/01: If you cast <Debt of Loyalty> but nothing happens to the targeted creature for the rest of the turn that would cause it to be destroyed, <Debt of Loyalty> has no visible effect. The regeneration shield wears off at the end of the turn. If the creature regenerates during a later turn, you won't gain control of it.
2008/04/01: If a creature has two regeneration shields on it — one from a <Debt of Loyalty> you cast and one from another effect — and it would be destroyed, its controller chooses which regeneration shield to use. If that player chooses to use the <Debt of Loyalty> shield, you'll gain control of the creature. If the player chooses to use the other shield, you won't gain control of the creature, but the <Debt of Loyalty> shield will remain on that creature for the rest of the turn (in case it would be destroyed again).
2008/04/01: You may cast <Debt of Loyalty> targeting a creature you already control. If you do, and that creature would be destroyed later in the turn, it will regenerate and you'll gain control of it (though gaining control of a creature you already control usually has no visible effect).
2013/07/01: A creature with indestructible never needs to regenerate, so <Debt of Loyalty> will have no effect on it.</Rulings>

All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want.

<Rulings>2008/04/01: Giving a creature flanking after blockers have been declared won't have any effect. Specifically: — If you give flanking to an attacking creature after blockers have been declared, it's too late for flanking to trigger. — If you give flanking to a creature that's blocking an attacking creature with flanking, it's too late to prevent the blocking creature from getting -1/-1, even if the attacker's flanking ability hasn't resolved yet.</Rulings>
