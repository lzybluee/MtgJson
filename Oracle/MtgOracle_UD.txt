This is because the <Flicker>ed permanent leaves the battlefield and then returns as a completely different permanent, and the targeted spell will not recognize it.

If Humility has the earliest timestamp, then everything is 4/4.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.

Humility becomes 1/1 and Worship becomes 1/1 (Humility). But if Humility entered the battlefield before <Opalescence>, the following is true: Layer 4: Humility and Worship each become creatures that are still enchantments (<Opalescence>). Layer 6: Humility and Worship each lose their abilities (Humility). Layer 7b: Humility becomes 1/1 and Worship becomes 1/1 (Humility).

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This card's ability does not override effects which prevent a permanent from untapping.
2005/08/01: Permanents with multiple types untap if any of their types is chosen. For example, an artifact creature untaps if either artifact or creature is chosen.
2005/08/01: If another effect limits the number of permanents that untap, that number combines with <Storage Matrix>'s effect. For example, Imi Statue says "players can't untap more than one artifact during their untap steps." If both Imi Statue and an untapped <Storage Matrix> are on the battlefield, and you choose "artifact," only one artifact untaps.</Rulings>
