This is because the <Flicker>ed permanent leaves the battlefield and then returns as a completely different permanent, and the targeted spell will not recognize it.
2005/08/01: This spell effectively "resets" the permanent to being just like it was freshly cast. All counters, Auras, effects, and so on are removed when it is exiled. Then it comes back onto the battlefield like new.</Rulings>

If Humility has the earliest timestamp, then everything is 4/4.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.

Humility becomes 1/1 and Worship becomes 1/1 (Humility). But if Humility entered the battlefield before <Opalescence>, the following is true: Layer 4: Humility and Worship each become creatures that are still enchantments (<Opalescence>). Layer 6: Humility and Worship each lose their abilities (Humility). Layer 7b: Humility becomes 1/1 and Worship becomes 1/1 (Humility).

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This card's ability does not override effects which prevent a permanent from untapping.
2005/08/01: Permanents with multiple types untap if any of their types is chosen. For example, an artifact creature untaps if either artifact or creature is chosen.
2005/08/01: If another effect limits the number of permanents that untap, that number combines with <Storage Matrix>'s effect. For example, Imi Statue says "players can't untap more than one artifact during their untap steps." If both Imi Statue and an untapped <Storage Matrix> are on the battlefield, and you choose "artifact," only one artifact untaps.</Rulings>
