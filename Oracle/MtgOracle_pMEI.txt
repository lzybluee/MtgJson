<Rulings>2004/10/04: The power of the creatures when the effect resolves is used to determine how much damage is done.

2004/10/04: Either or both creatures can be tapped prior to using the ability and it still works.
2006/09/25: If either target is illegal at the time the ability resolves (whether because it has left the battlefield, because it has gained Shroud or Protection, or for any other reason), the ability taps the remaining target, but no damage is dealt. If both targets are illegal, the ability is countered.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as <Fireball> resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

<Flavor>For every eye, an eye. For every tooth, a tooth. Griffins are nothing if not fair.</Flavor>
<Artist>Jesper Ejsing</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: The source of combat damage is the creature that dealt it.
2009/05/01: If a spell causes damage to be dealt, that spell will always identify the source of the damage. In most cases, the source is the spell itself. For example, Breath of Malfegor says "Breath of Malfegor deals 5 damage to each opponent."
2009/05/01: If an ability causes damage to be dealt, that ability will always identify the source of the damage. The ability itself is never the source. However, the source of the ability is often the source of the damage. For example, Deathbringer Thoctar's ability says "Deathbringer Thoctar deals 1 damage to target creature or player."
2009/05/01: If the source of the damage is a permanent, <Retaliator Griffin> checks whether an opponent controls that permanent at the time that damage is dealt. If the permanent has left the battlefield by then, its last known information is used. If the source of the damage is a spell, whether it's controlled by an opponent is obvious. If the source of the damage is a card in some other zone (such as a cycled Jund Sojourners), <Retaliator Griffin> checks whether the card's owner, rather than its controller, is an opponent.
2009/05/01: If <Retaliator Griffin> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you're dealt damage by a source an opponent controls, <Retaliator Griffin> will be put into a graveyard before it would receive any counters. Its ability will still trigger, but it will do nothing when it resolves.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/06/01: A card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in that mana cost, regardless of how that cost may have been paid.
2011/06/01: To calculate the converted mana cost of a card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, count each Phyrexian mana symbol as 1.
2011/06/01: As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.
2011/06/01: If you're at 1 life or less, you can't pay 2 life.
2011/06/01: Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.

<Rulings>2011/01/01: As <Ratchet Bomb>'s last ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine how many charge counters were on it.

2011/01/01: If <Ratchet Bomb>'s second ability is activated while it has no charge counters on it, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2011/01/01: If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2014/07/18: If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/07/18: In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
2014/07/18: While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
2014/07/18: While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
2014/07/18: Because you're casting the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

It won't enter the battlefield and constellation abilities won't trigger. An Aura spell with bestow won't be countered this way. It will revert to being an enchantment creature and resolve, entering the battlefield and triggering constellation abilities.
2014/04/26: When an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, each constellation ability of permanents you control will trigger. You can put these abilities on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>

Will of the council — When Magister of Worth enters the battlefield, starting with you, each player votes for grace or condemnation.

If condemnation gets more votes or the vote is tied, destroy all creatures other than Magister of Worth.</CardText>

<Rulings>2014/05/29: Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
2014/05/29: You must vote for one of the available options. You can't abstain.
2014/05/29: No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
2014/05/29: Players can't do anything after they finishing voting but before the spell or ability that included the vote finishes resolving.
2014/05/29: The phrase "the vote is tied" refers only to when there is more than one choice that received the most votes. For example, if a 5-player vote from among three different choices ends 3 votes to 1 vote to 1 vote, the vote isn't tied.</Rulings>

Morph {2} (You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for {3}. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)
When Rattleclaw Mystic is turned face up, add {G}{U}{R} to your mana pool.</CardText>
<Artist>Min Yum</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/09/20: Although turning a face-down creature with morph face up doesn't use the stack, <Rattleclaw Mystic>'s triggered ability does use the stack, and players can respond to that ability. Notably, you can't turn <Rattleclaw Mystic> face up while casting a spell or activating an ability. You'll need to turn <Rattleclaw Mystic> face up and have its triggered ability resolve before you can spend that mana.
2014/09/20: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
2014/09/20: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
2014/09/20: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
2014/09/20: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
2014/09/20: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/09/20: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/09/20: At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
2014/09/20: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
2014/09/20: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/07/18: You may activate the first ability with no targets. If you do, you simply put a loyalty counter on Ajani to pay the cost of the ability.
2014/07/18: If a permanent you control is both a creature and a planeswalker, Ajani's second ability will put both a +1/+1 counter and a loyalty counter on it.
2014/07/18: The emblem's ability doesn't consider who controls the source dealing damage to you or a planeswalker you control.
2014/07/18: Each attacking creature is a separate source of damage. For example, if two 3/3 creatures attack you and are unblocked, the emblem will prevent 2 damage from each creature. You'll be dealt a total of 2 damage.
2014/07/18: If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Dictate of the Twin Gods says, "If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead." Suppose you would be dealt 3 damage while Dictate of the Twin Gods is on the battlefield and you control Ajani's emblem. You can either (a) prevent all but 1 damage first and then let Dictate of the Twin Gods's effect double that, for a result of being dealt 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent all but 1 of that damage.</Rulings>

2014/07/18: The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Playing it follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2014/07/18: If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
2014/07/18: In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
2014/07/18: While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
2014/07/18: While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
2014/07/18: Because you're casting the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Count the number of tapped creatures you control as the ability resolves to determine the value of X.
2014/11/24: The creature you put the counters on doesn't have to be one of the tapped creatures.
2014/11/24: Bolster itself doesn't target any creature, though some spells and abilities that bolster may have other effects that target creatures. For example, you could put counters on a creature with protection from white with Abzan Skycaptain's bolster ability.

2014/11/24: Prowess triggers only once for any spell, even if that spell has multiple types.
2014/11/24: Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.

<ManaCost>4R (5)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Whenever Flamerush Rider attacks, create a token that's a copy of another target attacking creature and that's tapped and attacking. Exile the token at end of combat.
Dash {2}{R}{R} (You may cast this spell for its dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and it's returned from the battlefield to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.)</CardText>
<Artist>Viktor Titov</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: You choose which opponent or opposing planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker <Flamerush Rider> is attacking.
2014/11/24: Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
2014/11/24: The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it doesn't copy any effects that may have turned a noncreature permanent into a creature. If the token isn't a creature as it enters the battlefield, it won't be attacking.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature had {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
2014/11/24: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Flamerush Rider> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
2014/11/24: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2014/11/24: If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, you won't exile that creature at end of combat. However, if <Flamerush Rider> creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you'll exile each of those tokens.
2014/11/24: If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2014/11/24: If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
2014/11/24: You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
2014/11/24: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.</Rulings>

<Name>Temur War Shaman</Name>
<Type>Creature — Human Shaman 4/5</Type>
<ManaCost>4GG (6)</ManaCost>
<CardText>When Temur War Shaman enters the battlefield, manifest the top card of your library. (Put that card onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
Whenever a permanent you control is turned face up, if it's a creature, you may have it fight target creature you don't control.</CardText>
<Artist>Raymond Swanland</Artist>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Artist>???</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/06/22: Hixus's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like Hixus have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield.
2015/06/22: If Hixus leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the creature that dealt combat damage to you won't be exiled.
2015/06/22: Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
2015/06/22: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/06/22: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/06/22: In a multiplayer game, if Hixus's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: You can cast a spell with awaken for its mana cost and get only its first effect. If you cast a spell for its awaken cost, you'll get both effects.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell will be countered if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.
2015/08/25: Awaken doesn't give the land you control a color. As most lands are colorless, in most cases the resulting land creature will also be colorless.</Rulings>

<CardText>Devoid (This card has no color.)
When Drowner of Hope enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature tokens. They have "Sacrifice this creature: Add {C} to your mana pool."
Sacrifice an Eldrazi Scion: Tap target creature.</CardText>
<Artist>James Zapata</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: You can sacrifice any Eldrazi Scion to activate <Drowner of Hope>'s last ability, not just one created by <Drowner of Hope>.
2015/08/25: You can't sacrifice the same permanent to pay two different costs. Notably, if you sacrifice an Eldrazi Scion to activate the last ability of <Drowner of Hope>, you won't add {C} to your mana pool.
2015/08/25: Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deckbuilding and game play.
2015/08/25: A card with devoid is just colorless. It's not colorless and the colors of mana in its mana cost.
2015/08/25: Other cards and abilities can give a card with devoid color. If that happens, it's just the new color, not that color and colorless.
2015/08/25: Devoid works in all zones, not just on the battlefield.
2015/08/25: If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.
2015/08/25: Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion creature token to add {C} to your mana pool is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/08/25: Some instants and sorceries that create Eldrazi Scions require targets. If all targets for such a spell have become illegal by the time that spell tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any Eldrazi Scions.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: A creature with lifelink dealing combat damage is a single life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, the ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2015/08/25: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>
