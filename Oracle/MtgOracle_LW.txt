<Rulings>2007/10/01: Abilities that trigger when a player gains life may trigger as a result of this ability.
2007/10/01: In other multiplayer formats, each player's life total is set to the highest life total within their range of influence. These changes happen at the same time. For example, if each player has a range of influence of one, and the players in the game are Alice (4 life), Barry (8 life), Carrie (11 life), and Doug (7 life), in that order, then Alice's life total will become 8 and Barry and Doug's life totals will each become 11.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team chooses one person on that team to gain the appropriate amount of life. This basically means that the triggered ability will set the life total of each team to that of the team with the highest life total.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: Each of the chosen modes happens sequentially. If a permanent has an ability that triggers whenever it or another permanent is destroyed, it will see permanents destroyed at the same time as it or before it, but not permanents destroyed by later modes.
2017/11/17: If the first and third modes are chosen, an artifact creature with converted mana cost 3 or less will have to be regenerated twice to survive. This is because the modes happen sequentially, and the regeneration "shield" is used up by the first one. (A similar thing happens with most of the other combinations.)
2017/11/17: If a card is exiled "until" another permanent leaves the battlefield, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after that permanent leaves the battlefield during <Austere Command>'s resolution, and it may be destroyed by a later mode.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: Activating the ability with X = 0 will cause all creatures you control to become 0/0 and be put into the graveyard.
2007/10/01: Activating the ability for a second time in the same turn will overwrite the first activation. For example, if you activate the ability with X = 4, then activate it with X = 1, each of your creatures will be 1/1.
2009/10/01: You apply power/toughness changing effects in a series of sublayers in the following order: (a) effects from characteristic-defining abilities; (b) effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (c) effects that modify power and/or toughness but don't set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value; (d) changes from counters; (e) effects that switch a creature's power and toughness. This card's effect is always applied in (b), which means that effects applied in sublayer (c), (d), or (e) will not be overwritten; they will be applied to the new value.
2013/07/01: Examples of creature types include Sliver, Goblin, and Soldier. Creature types appear after the dash on the type line of creatures.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: If <Oblivion Ring> leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve and exile the targeted nonland permanent forever.
2007/10/01: If there are no nonland permanents on the battlefield other than an <Oblivion Ring>, and the card it exiled was another <Oblivion Ring>, casting a third <Oblivion Ring> will result in an involuntary infinite loop that will end the game in a draw (unless someone chooses to break it by putting another nonland permanent onto the battlefield or destroying one of the <Oblivion Ring>s, for example).
2008/10/01: If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything, but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled forever.
2012/07/01: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: The last ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into its owner's graveyard from any zone, not just from on the battlefield.
2007/10/01: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it doesn't *specifically* trigger on leaving the battlefield, so it doesn't behave like other leaves-the-battlefield abilities. The ability will trigger from the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

If a spell or ability you control would counter a spell, instead exile that spell and you may play that card without paying its mana cost.

<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>140190</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: <Guile>'s second ability replaces "counter [a certain spell]" with "exile [a certain spell] and you may cast it without paying its mana cost." You have the option to cast it immediately upon its exile. If you choose not to, it remains exiled and you don't get another chance to cast it. If the spell or ability that tried to counter the spell has additional effects, it then continues to resolve.
2007/10/01: Exiling the spell is mandatory. Casting it is not.
2007/10/01: A spell exiled this way was never actually countered.
2007/10/01: If a spell or ability you control attempts to counter a spell that can't be countered, it doesn't. Since the spell wouldn't be countered, <Guile>'s ability has no effect on it. The spell will continue to resolve normally.
2007/10/01: The last ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into its owner's graveyard from any zone, not just from on the battlefield.
2007/10/01: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it doesn't *specifically* trigger on leaving the battlefield, so it doesn't behave like other leaves-the-battlefield abilities. The ability will trigger from the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

2018/07/13: If a creature with evoke enters the battlefield without being cast, you won't have to sacrifice it.

2007/10/01: The targeted Shapeshifter copies the printed values of the targeted creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature. It won't copy effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2007/10/01: The copy effect doesn't wear off until just before your next untap step (even if an effect will cause that untap step to be skipped).
2007/10/01: If the targeted Shapeshifter becomes a copy of a face-down creature, it will become a 2/2 creature with no name, creature type, abilities, mana cost, or color. It will not become face down and thus can't be turned face up.
2007/10/01: Effects that have already applied to the targeted Shapeshifter will continue to apply to it. For example, if Giant Growth had given it +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then this ability makes it a copy of Grizzly Bears, it will be a 5/5 Grizzly Bears.

<Artist>Rebecca Guay</Artist>
<Multiverseid>139429</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/10/01: The value of X needs to be determined both when the ability triggers (so you can choose a target) and again when the ability resolves (to check if that target is still legal). If the number of Faeries you control has decreased enough in that time to make the target illegal, <Spellstutter Sprite>'s ability won't resolve (and the targeted spell will resolve as normal).</Rulings>

2007/10/01: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it doesn't *specifically* trigger on leaving the battlefield, so it doesn't behave like other leaves-the-battlefield abilities. The ability will trigger from the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: The last ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into its owner's graveyard from any zone, not just from on the battlefield.
2007/10/01: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it doesn't *specifically* trigger on leaving the battlefield, so it doesn't behave like other leaves-the-battlefield abilities. The ability will trigger from the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.
2007/10/01: If the Incarnation is removed from the graveyard after the ability triggers but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles their library. Similarly, if a replacement effect has the Incarnation move to a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won't trigger at all.</Rulings>

<CardText>You may choose new targets for target instant or sorcery spell. Then copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Flavor>"I knew that trick long before your great-grandmother's great-grandmother was born."</Flavor>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>146600</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: <Wild Ricochet> can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
2013/07/01: When <Wild Ricochet> resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. The controller of the original spell retains control of that spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
2013/07/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/07/01: If the spell <Wild Ricochet> copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Volcanic Geyser does), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/07/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with <Wild Ricochet>, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/07/01: If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.</Rulings>

2007/10/01: If the Incarnation had lost this ability while on the battlefield (due to Lignify, for example) and then was destroyed, the ability would still trigger and it would get shuffled into its owner's library. However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.

<CardText>Hideaway (This land enters the battlefield tapped. When it does, look at the top four cards of your library, exile one face down, then put the rest on the bottom of your library.)

<Rulings>2007/10/01: At the time the ability resolves, you'll get to play the card if you declared three different creatures as attackers at any point in the turn. A creature declared as an attacker in two different attack phases counts only once. A creature that entered the battlefield attacking (such as a token created by Militia's Pride) doesn't count because you never attacked with it.</Rulings>
