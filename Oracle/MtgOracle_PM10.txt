<CardText>Whenever Mycoid Shepherd or another creature you control with power 5 or greater dies, you may gain 5 life.</CardText>
<Artist>Jarreau Wimberly</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: <Mycoid Shepherd>'s ability will trigger when it's put into a graveyard from the battlefield no matter what its power is at that time.
2009/05/01: If another creature you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, <Mycoid Shepherd>'s ability checks that creature's power as it last existed on the battlefield. If it was 5 or greater, the ability will trigger.
2009/05/01: If <Mycoid Shepherd> and another creature you control with power 5 or greater are put into a graveyard from the battlefield at the same time, <Mycoid Shepherd>'s ability will trigger twice.</Rulings>

<Name>Naya Sojourners</Name>
<Type>Creature — Elf Shaman 5/3</Type>
<ManaCost>2RGW (5)</ManaCost>
<CardText>When you cycle Naya Sojourners or it dies, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
Cycling {2}{G} ({2}{G}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)</CardText>
<Flavor>The elves had entered a land like an open grave-an act of fortitude or folly?</Flavor>
<Artist>Michael Bruinsma</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/05/01: The triggered ability acts as a cycle-triggered ability or as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, as appropriate. The player who controls the triggered ability is the player who cycled the Sojourner, or the player who last controlled the Sojourner on the battlefield.
2009/05/01: If you cycle this card, the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2009/05/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2009/05/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<CardText>Play with the top card of your library revealed.
As long as the top card of your library is black, Vampire Nocturnus and other Vampire creatures you control get +2/+1 and have flying.</CardText>
<Flavor>"Your life will set with the sun."</Flavor>
<Artist>Andrew Robinson</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: To work as an evasion ability, an attacking creature must already have flying when the declare blockers step begins. Once a creature has become blocked, giving it flying won't change that.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.
2013/07/01: If the top card of your library is black, <Vampire Nocturnus> will give itself +2/+1 and flying even if it's somehow not a Vampire.</Rulings>
