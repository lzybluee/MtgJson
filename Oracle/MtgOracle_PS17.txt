<Name>Gideon of the Trials</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Gideon (Loyalty: 3)</Type>
<ManaCost>1WW (3)</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+1]: Until your next turn, prevent all damage target permanent would deal.
[0]: Until end of turn, Gideon of the Trials becomes a 4/4 Human Soldier creature with indestructible that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn.
[0]: You get an emblem with "As long as you control a Gideon planeswalker, you can't lose the game and your opponents can't win the game."</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: Gideon's first ability will continue to prevent damage dealt by the target permanent even if Gideon leaves the battlefield before your next turn.
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
2017/04/18: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2017/04/18: Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2017/04/18: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
2017/04/18: If Gideon leaves the battlefield after giving you his emblem, you'll keep the emblem. Its effect will apply again later if another Gideon comes under your control.
2017/04/18: No game effect can cause you to lose the game or cause any opponent to win the game while Gideon's emblem is in effect. It doesn't matter whether you have 0 or less life, you're forced to draw a card while your library is empty, you have ten or more poison counters, you're at your Glorious End, your opponent casts a second Approach of the Second Sun, or so on. You keep playing.
2017/04/18: Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your Magic Online® game clock runs out of time.
2017/04/18: If you have Gideon's emblem in a Two-Headed Giant game and control a Gideon planeswalker, your team can't lose the game and the opposing team can't win the game. If your teammate controls a Gideon planeswalker but you do not, your emblem's effect doesn't apply.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>3UU (5)</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+1]: Scry 1, then draw a card.
[-2]: Return target creature to its owner's hand.
[-8]: You get an emblem with "Whenever an opponent casts their first spell each turn, counter that spell."</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The emblem's triggered ability counters the first spell an opponent casts on each turn, not just that opponent's turn.
2016/04/08: If Jace's emblem's triggered ability doesn't counter the first spell an opponent casts (perhaps because that spell can't be countered), it won't trigger again in the same turn to try to counter that player's second spell.
2016/04/08: If you have multiple opponents, Jace's emblem can trigger once each turn for each opponent.</Rulings>

<Name>Chandra, Torch of Defiance</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra (Loyalty: 4)</Type>
<ManaCost>2RR (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+1]: Exile the top card of your library. You may cast that card. If you don't, Chandra, Torch of Defiance deals 2 damage to each opponent.
[+1]: Add {R}{R}.
[-3]: Chandra, Torch of Defiance deals 4 damage to target creature.
[-7]: You get an emblem with "Whenever you cast a spell, this emblem deals 5 damage to any target."</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: An effect that instructs you to "cast" a card doesn't allow you to play lands. If the card exiled with Chandra's first ability is a land card, you can't play it and Chandra deals 2 damage to each opponent.
2016/09/20: If you cast the exiled card, you do so as part of the resolution of Chandra's ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.
2016/09/20: You pay the costs for the exiled card if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as emerge rather than the card's mana cost.
2016/09/20: Loyalty abilities can't be mana abilities. Chandra's second ability uses the stack and can be countered or otherwise responded to. Like all loyalty abilities, it can be activated only once per turn, during your main phase, when the stack is empty, and only if no other loyalty abilities of the planeswalker have been activated this turn.
2016/09/20: The emblem created by Chandra's last ability is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.
2016/09/20: Chandra's emblem's ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger.
2016/09/20: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Chandra's first ability causes 4 damage total to be dealt to the opposing team.</Rulings>

<Name>Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Bolas (Loyalty: 7)</Type>
<ManaCost>4UBR (7)</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+2]: Target opponent exiles cards from the top of their library until they exile a nonland card. Until end of turn, you may cast that card without paying its mana cost.
[+1]: Each opponent exiles two cards from their hand.
[-4]: Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh deals 7 damage to target opponent, creature an opponent controls, or planeswalker an opponent controls.
[-12]: Exile each nonland permanent your opponents control.</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/07/14: The cards exiled by Nicol Bolas's first and second abilities are exiled face up.
2017/07/14: You may cast the nonland card exiled by Nicol Bolas's first ability that turn even if Nicol Bolas is no longer on the battlefield or under your control.
2017/07/14: Casting the card exiled with Nicol Bolas's first ability follows the normal timing rules for casting that card. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
2017/07/14: If you don't cast the card exiled by Nicol Bolas's first ability that turn, it will remain exiled.
2017/07/14: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, you must pay those to cast the card.
2017/07/14: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
2017/07/14: While resolving Nicol Bolas's second ability, each opponent chooses which cards to exile from their hand. Any opponent with two or fewer cards exiles their entire hand.
2017/07/14: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spell or permanent cards you control from Nicol Bolas's first ability are exiled.</Rulings>

<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Nissa (Loyalty: X)</Type>
<ManaCost>XGU (2)</ManaCost>
<CardText>[+2]: Scry 2.
[0]: Look at the top card of your library. If it's a land card or a creature card with converted mana cost less than or equal to the number of loyalty counters on Nissa, Steward of Elements, you may put that card onto the battlefield.
[-6]: Untap up to two target lands you control. They become 5/5 Elemental creatures with flying and haste until end of turn. They're still lands.</CardText>
<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2017/04/18: If X is 0, Nissa enters the battlefield with no loyalty and is put into her owner's graveyard before you can activate her abilities.
2017/04/18: While resolving Nissa's second ability, if you can't or don't put the card onto the battlefield, it remains on top of your library.
2017/04/18: Once Nissa's second ability begins to resolve, no player may take actions until it's done. Notably, players can't try to change Nissa's loyalty once you look at the card or choose to put it onto the battlefield.
2017/04/18: If Nissa leaves the battlefield while her second ability is on the stack, use her last known loyalty to determine whether you may put the top card of your library onto the battlefield. If Nissa left the battlefield because she took enough damage to reduce her loyalty to 0, then her last known loyalty is 0.
2017/04/18: Nissa's last ability sets the base power and toughness of the lands to 5/5. Any +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters that were on those lands will apply to those values.</Rulings>
