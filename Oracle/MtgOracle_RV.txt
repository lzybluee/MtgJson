<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>
<Artist>Anson Maddocks</Artist>
<Multiverseid>1143</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: Note that bringing the Shadow back onto the battlefield from the graveyard is not a spell, it is an ability. It can't be countered with something that counters spells.
2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.
2008/10/01: A card is "above" another card in your graveyard if it was put into that graveyard later.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: Since this is an instant, your opponent may use instants in response to the casting of this spell. Note that such spells and abilities will be resolved before the mana pool is emptied by the <Mana Short>. This makes it useless as a countermeasure for spells. To use it effectively, you need to use it during Upkeep and even then it will not prevent the use of instant spells and abilities.
2004/10/04: If you play <Mana Short> in response to a spell, it will have no effect on that spell since the mana has already been paid.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/11/17: For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, <Fireball> has a total cost of {7}{R} (even though its mana cost is just {5}{R} and its converted mana cost is 6).

2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: You need not (and may not) pay any additional mana or other costs (like sacrifices) to use the spell which is <Fork>ed. You get control over a complete copy but can change nothing except the targets.
2004/10/04: <Fork> does not let you make non-targeting choices about the spell.
2004/10/04: When a spell with additional costs is copied, you don't have to pay those costs again.
2004/10/04: If you copy a spell for which Buyback has been paid, you get nothing back since the copied spell does not have a card to give you.
2004/10/04: The copy that is placed on the stack is not considered to have been "cast".
2004/10/04: The <Fork> card goes to the graveyard when it resolves and leaves the copy on the stack. There is no card representing the copy on the stack.
2004/10/04: It does copy the mana symbols in the mana cost for the card it is copying, but it uses its own color definition and not the one from those mana symbols. This is so it maintains its color just like the text says.
2004/10/04: If the spell being copied targets a spell on the stack, it is possible to target <Fork> itself since <Fork> is still on the stack when you pick the target(s) for the copy. Note that the copy's target will be illegal when it resolves.
2004/10/04: For spells that can have a variable number of targets, the controller of the copy must use the same number of targets the original spell did.
2004/10/04: <Fork>ing a spell with an X in the cost requires you to use the same X value.
2004/12/01: If you <Fork> a Spliced spell, the spliced text is added during the announcement of the original spell, and therefore is fully copied by <Fork>.
2009/05/01: The copy will have the same mana cost as the original spell, but will be red rather than whatever color that mana cost would have made it.
2009/10/01: If the targeted spell was kicked, then the copy will be kicked as well. If the targeted spell was not kicked, then the copy will not be kicked.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Multiverseid>1329</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: You can't use the <Library of Leng> ability to place a discarded card on top of your library when you discard a card as a cost, because costs aren't effects.

2004/10/04: You can look at a randomly discarded card before deciding where it goes.
2004/10/04: This effect has no effect on the cards being put into the graveyard from a library, because they are not "discarded".
2004/10/04: If more than one card is discarded due to a single effect, the Library allows you to decide whether or not to use it on each of the cards. You get to decide the order the cards are placed on the library if more than one goes there.
2004/10/04: Since the card goes directly to the library, the card is not revealed unless the spell or ability requiring the discard specifically says it is.
2004/10/04: The ability replaces the normal discard action with a discard action that puts the card on the library instead of the graveyard.
2004/10/04: The ability applies any time a spell or ability has you discard as part of its effect. It does not matter if you or your opponent control the spell or ability. The discard is forced because it is an effect.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put <Library of Leng> onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: You can choose different targets for each use.
2004/10/04: Because it does not have tapping as part of its activation cost, you can activate the ability many times in one turn, but it is destroyed at the end of any turn in which you use it.
2004/10/04: It is only destroyed at end of turn if the ability resolved. If the ability is countered, it is not sacrificed.</Rulings>
