2009/02/01: Plainscycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Plainscycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Plainscycling from being activated.

<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you control more than one, each time you take damage you can decide which one replaces the damage, and that one replaces all of the damage. You can't split the damage between them. You decide each time you take damage. Note that damage from multiple sources that happens at one time (such as combat damage) gives one choice, not one per source.
2004/10/04: If you take 6 damage at once, it will replace all 6 damage and put 6 counters on it. Then the second ability will trigger. Any additional damage you take before this ability resolves also results in counters, but once the ability resolves, this card is sacrificed.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: The copies are put directly onto the stack. They aren't cast and won't be counted by other spells with storm cast later in the turn.
2013/06/07: Spells cast from zones other than a player's hand and spells that were countered are counted by the storm ability.
2013/06/07: A copy of a spell can be countered like any other spell, but it must be countered individually. Countering a spell with storm won't affect the copies.
2013/06/07: The triggered ability that creates the copies can itself be countered by anything that can counter a triggered ability. If it is countered, no copies will be put onto the stack.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>43537</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: Unlike the normal cycling ability, Forestcycling doesn't allow you to draw a card. Instead, it lets you search your library for a Forest card. After you find a Forest card in your library, you reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is a form of cycling. Any ability that triggers on a card being cycled also triggers on Forestcycling this card. Any ability that stops a cycling ability from being activated also stops Forestcycling from being activated.
2009/02/01: Forestcycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with Forestcycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2009/02/01: You can choose to find any card with the Forest land type, including nonbasic lands. You can also choose not to find a card, even if there is a Forest card in your library.</Rulings>
