<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>
<Artist>Anson Maddocks</Artist>
<Multiverseid>3823</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: A card is "above" another card in your graveyard if it was put into that graveyard later.
2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>3872</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/09/16: The losses, discards, and sacrifices are rounded up. For example, if you have 5 life, you'll lose 2 life, leaving you at 3 life. (Five divided by three is one and two-thirds. Rounding that up to the nearest whole number gives you two.)
2007/09/16: Each part of <Pox>'s effect is processed separately. For each part, first the player whose turn it is makes all necessary choices (such as which cards to discard), then each other player in turn order chooses, then the actions happen at the same time. Then <Pox>'s effect moves to the next stage.
2007/09/16: The number you need to lose, discard, or sacrifice isn't calculated until it's time to perform that part of the effect. For example, if your opponent casts <Pox> and you discard Dodecapod as part of <Pox>'s discard effect, Dodecapod will be put onto the battlefield instead of into your graveyard. Then, when determining how many creatures you need to sacrifice, the Dodecapod is taken into account.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>3880</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/05/01: The ability grants you control of all creatures that are blocking it as the ability resolves. This will include any creatures that were put onto the battlefield blocking it.
2009/05/01: Any blocking creatures that regenerated during combat will have been removed from combat. Since such creatures are no longer in combat, they cannot be blocking <The Wretched>, which means you won't be able to gain control of them.
2009/05/01: If <The Wretched> itself regenerated during combat, then it will have been removed from combat. Since it is no longer in combat, there cannot be any creatures blocking it, which means you won't be able to gain control of any creatures.
2009/10/01: <The Wretched>'s ability triggers only if it's still on the battlefield when the end of combat step begins (after the combat damage step). For example, if it's blocked by a 7/7 creature and is destroyed, its ability won't trigger at all.
2009/10/01: If <The Wretched> leaves the battlefield, you no longer control it, so the duration of its control-change effect ends.

2004/10/04: The ability is targeted and checks the validity of the target when put on the stack and when resolving. If the creature is not still there when the copy ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve and no token is put onto the battlefield. This card remains on the battlefield as an enchantment with no token.

Then its first ability will resolve and put a token onto the battlefield.

2004/10/04: If there is no other legal target for the spell, this does not change the target.

<Artist>James Allen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>4090</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/08/01: If the Giant's power and/or toughness change so that its toughness is less than its power, you can have the ability target the Giant itself.
2009/10/01: To work as an evasion ability, an attacking creature must already have flying when the declare blockers step begins. Once a creature has become blocked, giving it flying won't change that.
2009/10/01: If <Stone Giant>'s ability is activated during a turn's end step, the delayed triggered ability won't trigger until the beginning of the next turn's end step. The targeted creature will be destroyed at that time.
2009/10/01: When the delayed triggered ability resolves, the targeted creature is destroyed, even if it's no longer a creature, no longer under your control, or no longer has toughness less than <Stone Giant>'s power at that time.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.

<Multiverseid>4156</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You do not get the creature back if the creature is not still in the graveyard at the end of the turn.
2007/09/16: If <Seraph> isn't on the battlefield at the time the other creature is put into a graveyard, the ability won't trigger. However, the ability does trigger if <Seraph> and the other creature are put into the graveyard at the same time.
2007/09/16: If the other creature is a token, it will cease to exist after being exiled. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2007/09/16: If the other creature ceases to be a creature card after it leaves the battlefield (it's an animated Mishra's Factory, for example), it will be returned to the battlefield by this ability and you will have to sacrifice it when you lose control of <Seraph>.
2007/09/16: Once the ability triggers, you'll return the card to the battlefield under your control at the end of the turn even if you no longer control <Seraph> at that time. In fact, if <Seraph> leaves the battlefield before the card is returned to the battlefield, you'll never have to sacrifice it as a result of this ability. If <Seraph> remains on the battlefield but changes controllers before the card is returned, you'll still get the returned card. However, in that scenario, you'll still have to sacrifice it if you later regain control <Seraph> and then lose control of it once more.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>3779</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: This is not considered to be drawing a card.
2004/10/04: If the Bottle leaves the battlefield or your control, the cards remain waiting until played or until the beginning of your next upkeep. The card is in the "Exile" zone.
2004/10/04: The card is not part of your hand in any way. You can't be forced to discard it due to a discard from hand effect, and you can't discard it to pay a cost.
2004/10/04: To "play a card" is to either cast a spell or to put a land onto the battlefield using the main phase special action.
2008/08/01: If you do not play the card before your next upkeep, it remains exiled; you just lose the ability to play it.
2008/10/01: The exiled card is played using the normal timing rules for its card type, as well as any other applicable restrictions such as "Cast [this card] only during combat." For example, you can't play the card during an opponent's turn unless it's an instant or has flash. Similarly, if the exiled card is a land, you can't play it if you've already played a land that turn. If it's a nonland card, you'll have to pay its mana cost. The only thing that's different is you're playing it from the Exile zone.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>3781</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.
2004/10/04: The ability can be activated if the opponent has no lands that produce mana, but the effect will not be able to generate any mana.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Fellwar Stone> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Artist>Alan Rabinowitz</Artist>
<Multiverseid>3785</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: As you activate the ability, the targets you choose must be two artifacts, two creatures, or two lands. As the ability resolves, both targets will be legal only if they are two artifacts, two creatures, or two lands at that time as well, though they may be a different type than they were at the time the ability was activated. For example, if the targets were a creature and an artifact creature when the ability was activated, but the first target became a noncreature artifact by the time the ability resolves, both targets will still be legal (since they're both artifacts).
2009/10/01: If one of the targets is illegal by the time the ability resolves (because the wrong player controls it, or it's the wrong card type, or for any other reason), the exchange doesn't happen. The target that's still legal will remain under its controller's control. Since the exchange doesn't happen, no Auras are destroyed. (If both targets are illegal, the ability doesn't resolve.)</Rulings>

The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.

2004/10/04: You can't use the <Library of Leng> ability to place a discarded card on top of your library when you discard a card as a cost, because costs aren't effects.
2004/10/04: The discard triggers anything else that triggers on discards.
2004/10/04: You can look at a randomly discarded card before deciding where it goes.
2004/10/04: The ability applies any time a spell or ability has you discard as part of its effect. It does not matter if you or your opponent control the spell or ability. The discard is forced because it is an effect.
2004/10/04: If more than one card is discarded due to a single effect, the Library allows you to decide whether or not to use it on each of the cards. You get to decide the order the cards are placed on the library if more than one goes there.
2004/10/04: Since the card goes directly to the library, the card is not revealed unless the spell or ability requiring the discard specifically says it is.
2004/10/04: The ability replaces the normal discard action with a discard action that puts the card on the library instead of the graveyard.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put <Library of Leng> onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>
