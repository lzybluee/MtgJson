<Rulings>2010/08/15: During your turn, <Angelic Arbiter>'s abilities have no effect on the game.
2010/08/15: During an opponent's turn, that opponent may either cast spells or attack with creatures, but not both (assuming that <Angelic Arbiter> is on the battlefield for the entirety of that turn). The player may perform other actions, such as activating abilities and playing lands.
2010/08/15: If <Angelic Arbiter> leaves the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities cease to affect the game. For example, if an opponent casts Doom Blade to destroy <Angelic Arbiter>, that player may then attack with creatures.
2010/08/15: If <Angelic Arbiter> enters the battlefield during an opponent's turn, its abilities take actions that player performed earlier in the turn into account, even though it wasn't on the battlefield at the time. For example, if an opponent casts a spell, then you use Leyline of Anticipation's ability to cast <Angelic Arbiter> as though it had flash, that player won't be able to attack with creatures that turn.
2010/08/15: <Angelic Arbiter>'s last ability applies if an opponent attacked with at least one creature during the current turn.</Rulings>

2005/10/01: If it targets a colorless creature, it doesn't affect any other creatures. A colorless creature shares a color with nothing, not even other colorless creatures.

2013/10/17: <Darksteel Mutation> overwrites any previous effects that set the enchanted creature's power or toughness to a specific value. Any such effects that start to apply after <Darksteel Mutation> entered the battlefield will work normally.
2013/10/17: However, <Darksteel Mutation> does not overwrite effects that change the enchanted creature's power or toughness without setting it to a specific value (such as the ones created by Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem). It also won't overwrite the effect of counters.
2013/10/17: The enchanted creature will be only an artifact and a creature, not any other card types. It will be only an Insect, not any other creature types.
2013/10/17: In some rare cases, the creature may have subtypes other than creature types before becoming enchanted with <Darksteel Mutation>. If it had any other artifact subtypes (such as Equipment), it will retain those. If it had any subtypes other than artifact types and creature types (such as Shrine), it won't retain those.
2013/10/17: The creature will keep any supertypes it previously had. Notably, if <Darksteel Mutation> is enchanting a legendary creature, that creature will continue to be legendary. Also, if it's enchanting a commander, that creature will continue to be a commander.
2013/10/17: <Darksteel Mutation> doesn't affect the enchanted creature's colors, if any. It will continue to be whatever color or colors it was before <Darksteel Mutation> entered the battlefield.
2013/10/17: <Darksteel Mutation> causes the enchanted creature to lose all abilities except indestructible at the time it becomes enchanted. Any abilities the creature gains after that point will work normally.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>430254</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/10/17: A Curse spell targets the player it will enchant like any other Aura spell, and a Curse stays on the battlefield like any other Aura. If the enchanted player gains protection from the Curse's color (or any other characteristic the Curse has), the Curse will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2013/10/17: Each of the Curses can be attached to any player, including the player who cast the Curse.
2013/10/17: Curse is an enchantment type, not a creature type (or any other kind of subtype).
2013/10/17: The ability won't trigger when a creature attacks a planeswalker controlled by the enchanted player.
2013/10/17: The Curse subtype has no inherent rules meaning, but two cards in the Innistrad set (Bitterheart Witch and Witchbane Orb) refer to Curses.
2013/10/17: <Curse of Inertia>'s ability will trigger only once per attacking player per combat phase, no matter how many creatures that player attacks with.
2013/10/17: Even though the attacking player chooses the target of the ability, the ability is still controlled by the player who controls <Curse of Inertia>. Notably, a creature with hexproof controlled by the player who controls <Curse of Inertia> could be chosen, even though another player may be choosing the target.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

2015/11/04: You choose whether each token is attacking the player or a planeswalker they control as the token is created.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: The first three times <Dragon Whelp>'s ability is activated in a turn will do nothing other than give it +1/+0 until end of turn. Any subsequent activations will also cause its delayed triggered ability to trigger. That means if you activate <Dragon Whelp>'s ability five times, for example, two different delayed triggered abilities will trigger at the beginning of the next end step and cause you to sacrifice <Dragon Whelp>.
2009/10/01: If the fourth (or more) time <Dragon Whelp>'s ability is activated during the same turn happens to be during that turn's end step, the delayed triggered ability won't trigger until the beginning of the next turn's end step. You'll have to sacrifice <Dragon Whelp> at that time.</Rulings>

2011/09/22: Since opponents can't search libraries, they won't be able to find any cards in a library. The effect applies to all opponents and all libraries, including your library. If a spell or ability's effect has other parts that don't depend on searching for or finding cards, they will still work normally.
2011/09/22: Effects that tell an opponent to reveal cards from a library or look at cards from the top of a library will still work. Only effects that use the word "search" will fail.
2011/09/22: An "extra turn" means a turn created by a spell or ability. It doesn't refer to a turn taken in a sanctioned tournament after the time limit for the round has expired.
2011/09/22: If an opponent's extra turn is created while <Stranglehold> is on the battlefield, but <Stranglehold> leaves the battlefield before that turn would begin, that opponent takes the extra turn as normal.</Rulings>

<Artist>Ryan Yee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430313</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.
2015/11/04: If the defending player is your only opponent, no tokens are put onto the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You choose whether each token is attacking the player or a planeswalker they control as the token is created.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/06/15: The abilities a leveler grants to itself don't overwrite any other abilities it may have. In particular, they don't overwrite the creature's level up ability; it always has that.
2010/06/15: Effects that set a leveler's power or toughness to a specific value, including the effects from a level symbol's ability, apply in timestamp order. The timestamp of each level symbol's ability is the same as the timestamp of the leveler itself, regardless of when the most recent level counter was put on it.
2010/06/15: Effects that modify a leveler's power or toughness, such as the effects of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2010/06/15: If another creature becomes a copy of a leveler, all of the leveler's printed abilities — including those represented by level symbols — are copied. The current characteristics of the leveler, and the number of level counters on it, are not. The abilities, power, and toughness of the copy will be determined based on how many level counters are on the copy.
2010/06/15: A creature's level is based on how many level counters it has on it, not how many times its level up ability has been activated or has resolved. If a leveler gets level counters due to some other effect (such as Clockspinning) or loses level counters for some reason (such as Vampire Hexmage), its level is changed accordingly.</Rulings>

If a creature with devour and another creature are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, the creature with devour can't devour that other creature.

2008/10/01: If multiple creatures with devour are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you may use each one's devour ability.

<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Multiverseid>430358</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2009/10/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>

2013/10/17: In formats other than Commander, <Opal Palace>'s last ability produces no mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: Oran-Rief's third ability cares about permanents' characteristics at the time the ability resolves, not their characteristics at the time they entered the battlefield. For example, if a blue creature enters the battlefield, then is turned green by a spell or ability, then Oran-Rief's second ability resolves, you'll put a +1/+1 counter on that creature.
2009/10/01: Oran-Rief's second ability affects all permanents that are green creatures that entered the battlefield this turn, not just the ones you control.</Rulings>
