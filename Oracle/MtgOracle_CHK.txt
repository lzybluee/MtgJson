2007/07/15: Ending the turn this way means the following things happen in order: 1) All spells and abilities on the stack are exiled. This includes <Time Stop>, though it will continue to resolve. It also includes spells and abilities that can't be countered. 2) All attacking and blocking creatures are removed from combat. 3) State-based actions are checked. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. The cleanup step happens in its entirety.
2007/07/15: If any triggered abilities do trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn finally ends.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/05/01: Putting the card onto the battlefield is optional. When the ability resolves, you can choose not to.
2013/06/07: You reveal all cards you intend to splice at the same time. Each individual card can be spliced only once onto any one spell.
2013/06/07: A card with a splice ability can't be spliced onto itself because the spell is on the stack (and not in your hand) when you reveal the cards you want to splice onto it.
2013/06/07: You choose all targets for the spell after revealing cards you want to splice, including any targets required by the text of any of those cards. You may choose a different target for each instance of the word "target" on the resulting spell.
2013/06/07: If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/12/01: <Tide of War>'s ability triggers only once each combat and only if at least one blocker is declared. The effect does nothing to unblocked attacking creatures.

2004/12/01: You can exile the card even if you choose no targets.
2013/04/15: In a Commander game, you may send Iname to the Command Zone instead of exiling it during the resolution of its ability. If you do, its ability still works. Iname's ability only requires that you attempted to exile it, not that it actually gets to the exile zone. This is similar to how destroying a creature (with, for example, Rest in Peace) doesn't necessarily ensure that creature will end up in the graveyard; it just so happens that the action of exiling something and the exile zone both use the same word: "exile".</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/12/01: The cost reduction applies to the total cost of the Arcane spell, including any additional costs from cards spliced onto it. However, the cost reduction applies only once to each Arcane spell. For example, if you cast an Arcane spell with mana cost {R} and splice onto it a card whose splice cost is {1}{U}, then the spell costs {U}{R} to cast. If you cast an Arcane spell with mana cost {4}{U} and splice onto it a card whose splice cost is {1}{R}, the spell costs {4}{U}{R} to cast.</Rulings>
