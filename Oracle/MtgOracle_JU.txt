2016/06/08: If Animate Dead is put onto the battlefield enchanting <Worldgorger Dragon>, <Worldgorger Dragon>'s enters-the-battlefield trigger will exile Animate Dead, which causes you to sacrifice <Worldgorger Dragon>, which causes Animate Dead to return to the battlefield attached to a creature card in a graveyard of your choice. If you can choose a creature card other than <Worldgorger Dragon>, you must do so after as many iterations of this loop as you'd like.
