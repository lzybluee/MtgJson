For example, if you've changed "green" to "blue," and the permanent gains protection from green (as opposed to having protection from green printed on it), that protection ability is unaffected.

2013/04/15: The type-changing effect can change part of a word such as "nonblack" or "swampwalk" if the part of the word is being used to refer to a color or basic land type.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal are card types. Two cards share a card type if they have at least one card type in common.
2013/04/15: The original spell is part of the group of exiled cards put on the bottom of the library in a random order. If the exiled card that shared a card type with that card wasn't cast, it's also part of this group.
2013/04/15: If <Possibility Storm>'s ability doesn't exile the original spell (perhaps because another <Possibility Storm> already exiled it), you'll still exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a card that shares a card type with it and have the opportunity to cast that spell.
2013/04/15: If you cast a spell without paying its mana cost, you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
2013/04/15: If the spell you cast from exile has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
2013/04/15: Instant and sorcery cards with miracle allow a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If a player casts a spell this way, the spell is cast from that player's hand. <Possibility Storm> will trigger.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s last ability triggers only once for each time combat damage is dealt, no matter how many creatures are dealing damage at that time.
2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability can trigger during each combat damage step. For example, if a creature with first strike deals combat damage, you can return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand and discard it using its bloodrush ability to pump up an attacking creature without first strike. Then, when that creature deals combat damage, you can return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand again.
2017/03/14: <Pyrewild Shaman>'s last ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard when the creatures deal combat damage to a player. It returns to your hand only if it's still in your graveyard when the ability resolves. Notably, if <Pyrewild Shaman> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability won't trigger.
2017/03/14: If creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at the same time (perhaps because it's a multiplayer game), <Pyrewild Shaman>'s ability will trigger once for each of those players. However, only the first such ability that you pay for will return <Pyrewild Shaman> to your hand. Even if it's put back into your graveyard before the other abilities resolve, it's considered a different <Pyrewild Shaman> than the one whose ability triggered.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.

<Rulings>2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
2013/04/15: If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: If you cast <Dragonshift> using overload, only creatures you control when it resolves will be affected. Creatures that come under your control later in the turn will not.
2013/04/15: Each affected creature will lose all other colors and creature types and be only red, blue, and a Dragon. Each will retain any other types it may have had, such as artifact.
2013/04/15: Each affected creature will lose any abilities it may have gained prior to <Dragonshift> resolving. Notably, this includes the ability to cast the copies of a card with cipher that's encoded on the creature, although that ability will return after the turn ends.
2013/04/15: If any of the affected creatures gains an ability after <Dragonshift> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2013/04/15: <Dragonshift> overwrites all previous effects that set a creature's power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set a creature's power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after <Dragonshift> resolves will overwrite this effect.
2013/04/15: Effects that modify the power or toughness of an affected creature, such as the effects of Phytoburst or Legion's Initiative, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: If a permanent's activated ability is on the stack when that permanent is detained, the ability will be unaffected.
2013/04/15: If a noncreature permanent is detained and later turns into a creature, it won't be able to attack or block.
2013/04/15: When a player leaves a multiplayer game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player's next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.

<Watermark>Rakdos</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>368981</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: An ability that triggers when something "attacks and isn't blocked" triggers in the declare blockers step after blockers are declared if (1) that creature is attacking and (2) no creatures are declared to block it. It will trigger even if that creature was put onto the battlefield attacking rather than having been declared as an attacker in the declare attackers step.
2013/04/15: <Master of Cruelties> isn't forced to attack, but if it does, it must do so alone. If you control another creature with an ability that says it must attack if able, that creature must attack and <Master of Cruelties> won't be able to.
2013/04/15: If <Master of Cruelties> attacks alone, another creature entering the battlefield attacking will have no effect on it. <Master of Cruelties> continues to be an attacking creature. The other attacking creature will assign combat damage normally, regardless of whether <Master of Cruelties>'s last ability triggers.
2013/04/15: <Master of Cruelties>'s last ability won't trigger if it attacks a planeswalker.
2013/04/15: For a player's life total to become 1, what actually happens is that the player loses (or in some rare cases, gains) the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the player's life total is 4 when the last ability resolves, it will cause that player to lose 3 life. Other effects that interact with life loss (or gain) will interact with this effect accordingly.
2013/04/15: Assigning no combat damage isn't the same as preventing that damage. Effects that make damage unpreventable will have no effect if no combat damage can be assigned.</Rulings>

<CardText>Play with the top card of your library revealed.
You may cast the top card of your library if it's an instant or sorcery card.

<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Watermark>Izzet</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>369062</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Melek doesn't affect the timing rules associated with when you can cast the card. If it's a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2013/04/15: You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can't pay additional costs for the copy that's created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/04/15: Melek's last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets.
2013/04/15: When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2013/04/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Debt to the Deathless has), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/04/15: Instant and sorcery cards with miracle allow a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If you cast a spell this way, you're casting it from your hand, not your library. Melek's ability won't trigger.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: <Progenitor Mimic> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2013/04/15: The original <Progenitor Mimic> will create tokens, but those token copies will not.
2013/04/15: If you choose to have <Progenitor Mimic> enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature, the triggered ability it gains will become part of its copiable values. For example, suppose <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear, a 2/2 green Bear creature with mana cost {1}{G}. The resulting object is a 2/2 green Bear creature named Runeclaw Bear with mana cost {1}{G} and with "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature." If another <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield as a copy of that creature, it will be a Runeclaw Bear with two instances of the triggered ability.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature is a token, <Progenitor Mimic> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Copying a token doesn't make <Progenitor Mimic> become a token.
2013/04/15: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2013/04/15: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2013/04/15: If <Progenitor Mimic> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2013/04/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Progenitor Mimic> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

You must choose the artifact creature as the artifact and the nonartifact creature as the creature. The same is true for any combination of types—you sacrifice a number of permanents as close to five as possible.
2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.

2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets.

2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.

2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.

Fuse (You may cast one or both halves of this card from your hand.)</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>369071</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>

Fuse (You may cast one or both halves of this card from your hand.)</CardText>
<Artist>Ryan Pancoast</Artist>
<Multiverseid>368950</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you're casting a split card with fuse from any zone other than your hand, you can't cast both halves. You'll only be able to cast one half or the other.
2013/04/15: To cast a fused split spell, pay both of its mana costs. While the spell is on the stack, its converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in both costs.
2013/04/15: You can choose the same object as the target of each half of a fused split spell, if appropriate.
2013/04/15: When resolving a fused split spell with multiple targets, treat it as you would any spell with multiple targets. If all targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen. If at least one target is still legal at that time, the spell resolves, but an illegal target can't perform any actions or have any actions performed on it.
2013/04/15: When a fused split spell resolves, follow the instructions of the left half first, then the instructions on the right half.
2013/04/15: On the stack, a split spell that hasn't been fused has only that half's characteristics and converted mana cost. The other half is treated as though it didn't exist.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two monocolor halves of different colors. If such a card is cast as a fused split spell, the resulting spell is multicolored. If only one half is cast, the spell is the color of that half. While not on the stack, such a card is multicolored.
2013/04/15: Some split cards with fuse have two halves that are both multicolored. That card is multicolored no matter which half is cast, or if both halves are cast. It's also multicolored while not on the stack.
2013/04/15: If a player names a card, the player may name either half of a split card, but not both. A split card has the chosen name if one of its two names matches the chosen name.
2013/04/15: If you cast a split card with fuse from your hand without paying its mana cost, you can choose to use its fuse ability and cast both halves without paying their mana costs.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: Returning <Maze's End> to its owner's hand is part of the cost to activate its last ability. Once that ability is announced, players can't respond to it until after you've paid its activation cost and returned <Maze's End> to hand.
2013/04/15: When the last ability of <Maze's End> resolves, you'll search for a Gate and put it onto the battlefield before checking to see if you win the game. This check will happen even if you don't put a Gate onto the battlefield this way. This check will happen only as the ability resolves, not at other times.
2013/04/15: Putting a Gate onto the battlefield with <Maze's End> doesn't count as the one land you can play during your turn. If it's your turn, you can play <Maze's End> or a different land card from your hand after its ability has resolved.
2013/04/15: Controlling multiple Gates with the same name has no effect on your ability to win the game with <Maze's End>. The excess Gates are simply ignored.</Rulings>
