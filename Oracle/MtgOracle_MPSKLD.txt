<CardText>Vigilance
When Cataclysmic Gearhulk enters the battlefield, each player chooses an artifact, a creature, an enchantment, and a planeswalker from among the nonland permanents they control, then sacrifices the rest.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>
<Multiverseid>420588</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2016/09/20: First the player whose turn it is chooses permanents they control, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by players who chose before them. All of the unchosen nonland permanents are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/09/20: A permanent with more than one type may be chosen as either of the types or both. For example, an artifact creature may be chosen as the artifact, the creature, or both. Choosing the same permanent twice this way has the same result as choosing it once.
2016/09/20: <Cataclysmic Gearhulk> will be sacrificed to its own ability if you don't choose it as your artifact or your creature.
2016/09/20: Lands can't be chosen and won't be sacrificed, even if they have other types (such as an artifact land).
2016/09/20: If you don't control any permanents of one of the types, you'll still choose the permanents of the types you do control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/09/20: If you cast the card, you do so as part of the resolution of <Torrential Gearhulk>'s triggered ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") still apply.
2016/09/20: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Incendiary Sabotage, you must pay those to cast the card.
2016/09/20: If the card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.</Rulings>

2015/06/22: If enough -1/-1 counters are put on <Hangarback Walker> at the same time to make its toughness 0 or less, the number of +1/+1 counters on it before it got any -1/-1 counters will be used to determine how many Thopter tokens you get. For example, if there are three +1/+1 counters on <Hangarback Walker> and it gets four -1/-1 counters, you'll get three Thopter tokens. That's because <Hangarback Walker>'s triggered ability checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

2008/05/01: Each card becomes a new object as it changes zones, so this effect will apply to it from scratch in the new zone. Zone-change replacement abilities that care about the new color (like "[color] permanents enter the battlefield tapped") won't work because those effects are applied as the card is entering its new zone. Zone-change triggered abilities that care about the new color (like "when a [color] permanent enters the battlefield" or "when you cast a [color] spell") will work because those effects apply after the card is already in its new zone.

<Multiverseid>420610</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/12/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact will trigger when <Sculpting Steel> enters the battlefield. Any "as enters the battlefield" or "enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen artifact will also work. For example, if <Sculpting Steel> copies an artifact creature with sunburst, the copy will get +1/+1 counters based on the number of different colors of mana used to pay <Sculpting Steel>'s total cost. If <Sculpting Steel> copies a noncreature artifact with sunburst, the copy will get charge counters based on the number of different colors of mana used to pay <Sculpting Steel>'s total cost.
2007/07/15: <Sculpting Steel> doesn't copy whether the original artifact is tapped or untapped. It also doesn't copy any counters on that artifact, any Auras or Equipment attached to that artifact, or any effects that are currently affecting that artifact — you get exactly what's printed on the chosen card and nothing more. So if you copy an animated Chimeric Staff, for example, you get a normal, nonanimated Chimeric Staff.
2007/07/15: If the chosen artifact is copying something else (for example, if the chosen artifact is another <Sculpting Steel>), then your <Sculpting Steel> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen artifact copied.
2007/07/15: If the chosen artifact is a token, your <Sculpting Steel> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield. Your <Sculpting Steel> is not considered to be a token.
2007/07/15: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Sculpting Steel> stays on the battlefield as an artifact that doesn't do much of anything.</Rulings>

Next apply any cost reducers. Finally look at the amount of mana you have to pay. If it's less than three mana, you'll pay three mana.
2004/12/01: Even with a cost reducer on the battlefield, spells can't cost less than three mana to cast.
2004/12/01: If a spell costs at least three mana due to additional costs, such as kicker costs, that's fine.
2004/12/01: You still need to pay any additional nonmana costs the spell has, such as sacrificing a creature or discarding cards.
2004/12/01: Casting a creature with morph face down already costs three mana, even though the converted mana cost of the face-down spell is zero, so <Trinisphere> normally doesn't modify the total cost of a face-down creature spell. However, if Dream Chisel is reducing that cost while <Trinisphere> is on the battlefield, you'll still have to pay three mana for the spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/12/01: The creature's power and the number of Islands you control matter only when the ability is activated and when it resolves. After that, only the fact that <Vedalken Shackles> remains tapped matters. If the creature stops being a creature, you'll keep control of it.
2004/12/01: If <Vedalken Shackles> becomes untapped before its ability resolves, you won't gain control of the creature.
2004/12/01: If <Vedalken Shackles> leaves the battlefield, it's no longer tapped, so the control-changing effect ends.</Rulings>
