<CardText>When you cast this spell, you may put two cards your opponents own from exile into their owners' graveyards. If you do, create three 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature tokens. They have "Sacrifice this creature: Add {C}."</CardText>
<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by Anafenza, the Foremost), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
2015/08/25: Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile their hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use Wasteland Strangler to put one of those cards into their graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.
2015/08/25: Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion creature token to add {C} is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/08/25: Some instants and sorceries that create Eldrazi Scions require targets. If all targets for such a spell have become illegal by the time that spell tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any Eldrazi Scions.</Rulings>

<CardText>When you cast this spell, you may search your library for a colorless creature card with converted mana cost 7 or greater, reveal it, then shuffle your library and put that card on top of it.
The first creature spell you cast each turn costs {2} less to cast.</CardText>
<Artist>Slawomir Maniak</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of any spell. It changes only the total cost you actually pay.
2015/08/25: <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability will look at the entire turn, even if <Conduit of Ruin> wasn't on the battlefield for some of it. Notably, if you cast <Conduit of Ruin> in a turn, then no other creature spell you cast that turn can be your first.
2015/08/25: <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability can't reduce the amount of colored mana you pay for a spell. It reduces only the generic component of that mana cost.
2015/08/25: If you control more than one <Conduit of Ruin>, the last ability of each of them applies only to the first creature spell you cast each turn, not to different spells; the first creature spell you cast each turn will cost {4} less.
2015/08/25: The first creature spell you cast each turn doesn't necessarily have to be the first spell you cast. You could cast a sorcery spell and then cast a creature spell that would get the discount.
2015/08/25: If there are additional costs to cast a spell, or if the cost to cast a spell is increased by an effect, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
2015/08/25: The cost reduction can apply to alternative costs (such as dash costs).
2015/08/25: If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has {X} in its mana cost, you choose the value of X before calculating the spell's total cost. For example, if the first creature spell you cast in a turn has a mana cost of {X}{G}, you could choose 2 as the value of X and pay {G} to cast the spell.
2015/08/25: If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has converge, you can't ignore the cost reduction of <Conduit of Ruin>'s last ability in order to spend more colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast a spell don't affect that spell's converted mana cost.
2015/08/25: For spells with {X} in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine if the spell's converted mana cost is even or not. For example, your opponent could cast Endless One (with mana cost {X}) with X equal to 5, but not with X equal to 6.
2015/08/25: For creatures on the battlefield with {X} in their mana costs, the value for X is 0. Mistcutter Hydra (a creature with mana cost {X}{G}) could block, but Endless One could not.

Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may return target nonland permanent card from your graveyard to your hand. If that land is a Plains, you may return that nonland permanent card to the battlefield instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Cynthia Sheppard</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: A "nonland permanent card" is an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker card.
2015/08/25: If you return an Aura to the battlefield this way, you choose what it will enchant as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target any player or permanent, so you could attach an Aura to a permanent with hexproof controlled by an opponent, for example. If there's nothing the Aura can legally enchant, it stays in the graveyard.
2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Gideon's first ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Specifically, your rally abilities won't trigger. (Of course, Gideon's second ability will cause rally abilities to trigger.)
2015/08/25: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2015/08/25: Gideon's first ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human, Soldier, and Ally. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human, Soldier, and Ally are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2015/08/25: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his first ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.</Rulings>

<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: A "nonland creature" is a creature that isn't also a land.
2015/08/25: You can cast a spell with awaken for its mana cost and get only its first effect. If you cast a spell for its awaken cost, you'll get both effects.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell won't resolve if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.
2015/08/25: Awaken doesn't give the land you control a color. As most lands are colorless, in most cases the resulting land creature will also be colorless.</Rulings>

When Drowner of Hope enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature tokens. They have "Sacrifice this creature: Add {C}."
Sacrifice an Eldrazi Scion: Tap target creature.</CardText>
<Artist>James Zapata</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: You can sacrifice any Eldrazi Scion to activate <Drowner of Hope>'s last ability, not just one created by <Drowner of Hope>.
2015/08/25: You can't sacrifice the same permanent to pay two different costs. Notably, if you sacrifice an Eldrazi Scion to activate the last ability of <Drowner of Hope>, you won't add {C}.
2015/08/25: Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deckbuilding and game play.
2015/08/25: A card with devoid is just colorless. It's not colorless and the colors of mana in its mana cost.
2015/08/25: Other cards and abilities can give a card with devoid color. If that happens, it's just the new color, not that color and colorless.
2015/08/25: Devoid works in all zones, not just on the battlefield.
2015/08/25: If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.
2015/08/25: Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion creature token to add {C} is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/08/25: Some instants and sorceries that create Eldrazi Scions require targets. If all targets for such a spell have become illegal by the time that spell tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any Eldrazi Scions.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Check the creature's power as <Exert Influence> resolves to see if it's less than or equal to the number of colors spent to cast <Exert Influence>. If it's greater, <Exert Influence> will finish resolving with no effect.
2015/08/25: Once you've gained control of a creature with <Exert Influence>, it doesn't matter what happens to its power. Raising it won't cause the control-changing effect to end.
2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, tap target creature an opponent controls. If that land is an Island, that creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.</CardText>
<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: <Guardian of Tazeem>'s landfall ability can target a creature that's already tapped. If the land that caused it to trigger was an Island, that creature won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
2015/08/25: The ability tracks the creature, but not its controller. If the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step has come around, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Exiling <Part the Waterveil> is part of its effect. If <Part the Waterveil> doesn't resolve, including if it was cast for its awaken cost and the land you control became an illegal target, it will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can cast a spell with awaken for its mana cost and get only its first effect. If you cast a spell for its awaken cost, you'll get both effects.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell won't resolve if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.

2015/08/25: If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by Anafenza, the Foremost), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
2015/08/25: You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
2015/08/25: Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile their hand of three cards face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use <Wasteland Strangler> to put one of those cards into their graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
2015/08/25: If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
2015/08/25: If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell won't resolve if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
2015/08/25: The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for {G}.

<Rulings>2015/08/25: A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
2015/08/25: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
2015/08/25: If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.</Rulings>

<Artist>Vincent Proce</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/08/25: Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deckbuilding and game play.
2015/08/25: A card with devoid is just colorless. It's not colorless and the colors of mana in its mana cost.
2015/08/25: Other cards and abilities can give a card with devoid color. If that happens, it's just the new color, not that color and colorless.
2015/08/25: Devoid works in all zones, not just on the battlefield.
2015/08/25: If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the Zendikar block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
2015/08/25: Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.
2015/08/25: Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion creature token to add {C} is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2015/08/25: Some instants and sorceries that create Eldrazi Scions require targets. If all targets for such a spell have become illegal by the time that spell tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any Eldrazi Scions.</Rulings>

<CardText>Veteran Warleader's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.
Tap another untapped Ally you control: Veteran Warleader gains your choice of first strike, vigilance, or trample until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Josu Hernaiz</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: The ability that defines <Veteran Warleader>'s power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield. If <Veteran Warleader> is on the battlefield, it will count itself.
2015/08/25: To activate the last ability, you can tap any other untapped Ally you control, including one that hasn't been under your control since the beginning of your most recent turn. (Note that ability doesn't use the tap symbol.)
2015/08/25: You choose which ability <Veteran Warleader> gains as the last ability resolves, not as you activate it.
2015/08/25: Vigilance matters only as attackers are declared. Giving a creature vigilance after that point won't untap it, even if it's attacking.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Aligned Hedron Network enters the battlefield, exile all creatures with power 5 or greater until Aligned Hedron Network leaves the battlefield. (Those creatures return under their owners' control.)</CardText>
<Flavor>The last hedron slotted into place, locking Ulamog in an infinite loop of binding energy.</Flavor>
<Artist>Richard Wright</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: Check the power of each creature as <Aligned Hedron Network>'s ability resolves to determine if it's exiled. It doesn't matter who controls the creature.
2015/08/25: If <Aligned Hedron Network> exiles multiple creatures, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
2015/08/25: If <Aligned Hedron Network> leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no creatures will be exiled.
2015/08/25: Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
2015/08/25: If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2015/08/25: The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after <Aligned Hedron Network> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
2015/08/25: In a multiplayer game, if <Aligned Hedron Network>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
2015/08/25: In some very rare situations, <Aligned Hedron Network> may enter the battlefield as a creature with power 5 or greater. If this happens, <Aligned Hedron Network> will exile itself along with other creatures with power 5 or greater. Those cards will immediately return to the battlefield. If this causes a loop with <Aligned Hedron Network> continually exiling and returning itself, the game will be a draw unless a player breaks the loop somehow.</Rulings>

2015/08/25: However, because these cards have basic land types, effects that specify a basic land type without also specifying that the land be basic can affect them.

<Rulings>2015/08/25: A land that becomes a creature may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
2015/08/25: This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
2015/08/25: When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2015/08/25: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if <Lumbering Falls> has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 6/6 creature that's still a land.</Rulings>
