<Rulings>2019/05/03: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text, such as equip. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Karn.
2019/05/03: Karn's first ability affects only artifacts on the battlefield. Activated abilities that work in other zones can still be activated.
2019/05/03: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2019/05/03: If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2019/05/03: Karn's last ability can't get a face-down card in exile, even if you know it's an artifact card.
2019/05/03: In a casual game, a card you choose from outside the game comes from your personal collection. In a tournament event, a card you choose from outside the game must come from your sideboard. You may look at your sideboard at any time.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daarken</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Ugin). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/05/03: A colorless spell whose mana cost is {2} or {1} will cost {0} to cast.
2019/05/03: Once you look at the exiled face-down card once, you may look at it again any time you wish. If another player gains control of the Spirit token, that player can't look at the exiled card.
2019/05/03: If the Spirit leaves the battlefield for any reason, you'll put the exiled card into your hand, even if Ugin left the battlefield before that happened.
2019/05/03: If you've activated Ugin's ability multiple times, you must keep track of which exiled card belongs to each Spirit token.
2019/05/03: If an effect such as that of Doubling Season causes Ugin to create two Spirit tokens, you still only exile one card from your library. You'll put that card into your hand the first time that either of the tokens leaves the battlefield.
2019/05/03: A land normally has no color, even if it can produce one or more colors of mana.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: Any counters that are put on Gideon remain on him while he's not a creature, even if they have no effect on a noncreature planeswalker.
2019/05/03: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon during your turn, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Oketra's first triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2019/05/03: In the Commander format, a commander's color identity isn't affected by color words (such as black) appearing in its text. If <God-Eternal Oketra> is your commander, your deck can't contain black mana symbols.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

<Artist>Lius Lasahido</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If you reveal a card this way, it remains revealed until Kefnet's triggered ability finishes resolving.
2019/05/03: It's important to reveal the first card you draw each turn (or choose not to reveal it) before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand. You look at the card as you draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.
2019/05/03: You don't have to reveal a drawn card if you don't wish to copy it at that time.
2019/05/03: You can reveal and copy an instant or sorcery card this way on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
2019/05/03: Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and copied with Kefnet's ability.
2019/05/03: If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word "draw," the card wasn't drawn.
2019/05/03: You can cast the copy only as Kefnet's triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the copy ceases to exist. You can't cast it later.
2019/05/03: You can cast the copy during the resolution of the triggered ability if it's a sorcery, no matter whose turn it is or which phase it is.
2019/05/03: If the card leaves your hand before Kefnet's triggered ability resolves, you'll copy it using its last known information.
2019/05/03: The copy is created in and cast from your hand.
2019/05/03: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Kefnet's ability). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2019/05/03: If you somehow control more than one <God-Eternal Kefnet> (perhaps because one is a Spark Double), you may reveal a card you draw for any number of their abilities. One at a time, each will copy the card if it's an instant or sorcery, and you may cast each of them. Each copy resolves before you cast the next, and each copy's cost is reduced by only {2}.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods leaves the graveyard or exile while its last ability is on the stack, it will remain in its new zone, even if that zone is a graveyard or exile.
2019/05/03: If the God's owner has two or fewer cards in their library, the God is put on the bottom of their library as its last ability resolves.
2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect. However, if an effect exiles it and would return it to the battlefield at a later time, the God's ability may return that card its owner's library first. If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.
2019/05/03: In a multiplayer game, if you put another player's God onto the battlefield under your control, it will be exiled as you leave the game. If you were still the controller of that God, you would control its triggered ability but you have left the game; that ability won't resolve and the card remains in exile. Similarly, if you lose the game at the same time that another player's God that you put onto the battlefield is destroyed, it remains in its owner's graveyard.
2019/05/03: If one of these Gods would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. If you save your commander this way, it doesn't die and you won't put it into your library. The same is true if it would be exiled.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: If your library has fewer than seven cards in it while resolving Jace's last ability, and Jace has already left the battlefield, you'll draw as many cards as you can and then win the game before state-based actions would cause you to lose the game for trying to draw from an empty library.</Rulings>

<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: Your opponents can each draw a maximum of one card each on each player's turn. Subsequent card draws during that turn are ignored.
2019/05/03: If an opponent hasn't drawn any cards in a turn and a spell or ability instructs that player to draw multiple cards, that player will just draw one card. However, if the draws are optional, the player can't choose to draw, even if they could draw one card this way.
2019/05/03: Narset will "see" cards drawn by opponents earlier in the turn she entered the battlefield, although Narset can't affect cards drawn before she entered the battlefield. For example, if an opponent draws two cards, then Narset enters the battlefield, that opponent can't draw more cards that turn, but the two drawn cards are unaffected.
2019/05/03: Replacement effects (such as that of Underrealm Lich or the first ability of Jace, Wielder of Mysteries) can't be used to replace draws that Narset disallows. However, if an opponent's first draw is replaced (by Underrealm Lich's ability, for example), that draw didn't happen and Narset won't stop the next draw (which may also be replaced by Underrealm Lich's ability).</Rulings>

<Artist>Viktor Titov</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: <Narset's Reversal> can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
2019/05/03: The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger.
2019/05/03: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2019/05/03: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
2019/05/03: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Finale of Promise does), the copy will have the same value of X.
2019/05/03: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2019/05/03: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
2019/05/03: If you copy a spell, you control the copy. <Narset's Reversal> and the copy resolve before the original spell would have resolved.
2019/05/03: If a spell is returned to its owner's hand, it's removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn't countered; it just no longer exists. This works against a spell that can't be countered.
2019/05/03: If a copy of a spell is returned to its owner's hand, it's moved there, then it will cease to exist as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>3U (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>You may have Spark Double enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature or planeswalker you control, except it enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it if it's a creature, it enters with an additional loyalty counter on it if it's a planeswalker, and it isn't legendary if that permanent is legendary.</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If the chosen permanent is copying something else (for example, if the chosen permanent is another <Spark Double>), then <Spark Double> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen permanent copied.
2019/05/03: <Spark Double> copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2019/05/03: <Spark Double> isn't legendary if it copies a legendary permanent, and this exception is copiable. If something else copies <Spark Double> later, that copy also won't be legendary. If you control two or more permanents with the same name but only one is legendary, the "legend rule" doesn't apply.
2019/05/03: If the copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2019/05/03: If the chosen permanent is a token, <Spark Double> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Spark Double> doesn't become a token in this case.
2019/05/03: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when <Spark Double> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
2019/05/03: If it copies a planeswalker, <Spark Double> enters with the appropriate number of loyalty counters as printed on the card plus one. If it copies a creature, <Spark Double> enters with a +1/+1 counter on it, plus any counters that will be put on it from abilities it copied and other abilities of other objects.
2019/05/03: If the copied permanent is affected by a type-changing effect, <Spark Double> may enter the battlefield with different permanent types than the copied permanent currently has. Use the characteristics of <Spark Double> as it enters the battlefield, not of the copied permanent, to determine whether it enters with an additional counter on it. Notably, if <Spark Double> copies a Gideon planeswalker that's a creature because its loyalty ability caused it to become a planeswalker creature, <Spark Double> enters as a noncreature planeswalker and doesn't get a +1/+1 counter. On the other hand, if <Spark Double> copies Gideon Blackblade during your turn, <Spark Double> enters as a planeswalker creature and gets both kinds of counters.
2019/05/03: If <Spark Double> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, it can't become a copy of that permanent. You may choose only a creature or planeswalker that's already on the battlefield.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: As Liliana's last ability resolves, the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's somehow an opponent's turn, that opponent) makes all of their choices for it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the unchosen permanents are sacrificed at the same time.
2019/05/03: The permanent types are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Supertypes, like legendary, aren't permanent types.
2019/05/03: While making choices for Liliana's last ability, if a permanent has more than one permanent type, it can count for any of them. For example, you could choose an artifact creature as the artifact you're sparing, another creature as the creature, and an enchantment creature as the enchantment. Similarly, you could choose an enchantment creature as both the creature and the enchantment that you're sparing, even if you control another creature and/or another enchantment.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: You can cast <Liliana's Triumph> even if some or all of your opponents will be unable to sacrifice a creature. If you control a Liliana planeswalker, they'll still discard a card, even if they couldn't sacrifice a creature.
2019/05/03: As <Liliana's Triumph> resolves, the opponent whose turn it is (or, if it's your turn, the next opponent in turn order) chooses a creature to sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, knowing the choices made before them. Then all the chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time. Then, if you control a Liliana planeswalker, in the same order, each opponent chooses a card in their hand without revealing it, and those cards are discarded at the same time.
2019/05/03: Whether you control an appropriate planeswalker is checked only as the spell resolves.
2019/05/03: Controlling more than one planeswalker of the appropriate type won't have any more of a benefit than just controlling one.</Rulings>

When Massacre Girl enters the battlefield, each other creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn. Whenever a creature dies this turn, each creature other than Massacre Girl gets -1/-1 until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rallis</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: <Massacre Girl>'s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability and its delayed triggered ability each affect only creatures on the battlefield at the time that those abilities resolve. Creatures that enter the battlefield or become creatures later in the turn won't get -1/-1 unless the delayed triggered ability triggers and resolves again later.
2019/05/03: Once <Massacre Girl>'s enters-the-battlefield ability has triggered, it doesn't matter whether <Massacre Girl> remains on the battlefield. The delayed triggered ability will be created as the enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.
2019/05/03: Creatures that die while <Massacre Girl>'s triggered ability is still on the stack won't cause its delayed triggered ability to trigger since that delayed triggered ability hasn't been created yet.
2019/05/03: A creature with 0 toughness doesn't die immediately. Rather, the creature dies the next time a player would receive priority. This means that any creatures whose toughness becomes 0 as <Massacre Girl>'s enters-the-battlefield ability resolves will remain on the battlefield until just after the delayed triggered ability has been created.
2019/05/03: If more than one creature dies at once, <Massacre Girl>'s delayed triggered ability triggers that many times.</Rulings>

<Artist>Yongjae Choi</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: Chandra's first ability triggers if she loses loyalty from being dealt damage, from her last loyalty ability being activated, or because an effect removes loyalty counters from her. If an effect simply causes Chandra to leave the battlefield, no counters were removed and so her ability doesn't trigger.
2019/05/03: If multiple creatures deal combat damage to Chandra at the same time, those counters are all removed at once, and her first ability triggers only once.
2019/05/03: If all of Chandra's loyalty counters are removed, her first ability has her deal damage even though she's left the battlefield.
2019/05/03: Chandra's loyalty abilities don't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.

2019/05/03: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Spark Harvest, you must pay those to cast the card.

2019/05/03: A split card that's an instant and a sorcery card may be the target of <Finale of Promise> twice. However, once you cast that card once, it can't be cast a second time.
2019/05/03: If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

2019/05/03: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one—" or the like), the copies will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
2019/05/03: If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2019/05/03: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.

2019/05/03: If the new creature leaves the battlefield before the end step, most likely because it died in combat, that card remains in its current zone. It won't return to your hand.
2019/05/03: If the new creature has an ability that triggers at the beginning of the end step, that ability will trigger and resolve even if the creature is returned to your hand during the end step before that ability resolves.

2019/05/03: If you control another player's God when it dies, you decide whether to put that card into its owner's library.
2019/05/03: If an effect exiles the God and immediately returns it to the battlefield, its last ability triggers but will have no effect.

If it does, the effect that exiled it won't return it later.

2019/05/03: If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided or assigned among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents they control simultaneously, divide the original amount before adding 1.

<CardText>Choose four. You may choose the same mode more than once.
• Create a 2/2 Citizen creature token that's all colors.
• Return target permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.
• Proliferate.
• You gain 4 life.</CardText>
<Artist>Wisnu Tan</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of <Planewide Celebration> in the order they are written. If a mode is chosen more than once, you perform that mode's instruction that many times sequentially.
2019/05/03: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2019/05/03: If the second mode is chosen at least once, and every target permanent card is an illegal target by the time <Planewide Celebration> tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. None of the other chosen modes happen. If only some of the targets are illegal targets but at least one is still legal, you still do as much as you can and the illegal targets aren't affected.
2019/05/03: The War of the Spark set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/05/03: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2019/05/03: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/05/03: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: Because it's a loyalty ability, Domri's first loyalty ability isn't a mana ability. It can be activated only any time you could cast a sorcery. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
2019/05/03: After Domri's first loyalty ability has resolved, no creature spells you cast can be countered during that turn, not just the one you spend the mana on.
2019/05/03: A spell or ability that counters spells can still target a creature spell you control after Domri's first loyalty ability has resolved. When that spell or ability resolves, the creature spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
2019/05/03: If Domri leaves the battlefield before his last ability resolves, most likely because he only had 2 loyalty when you activated the ability, the creature won't have +1/+0 from Domri's static ability while it fights.

<Artist>Daniel Ljunggren</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: You can't cast <Enter the God-Eternals> without targeting a creature and a player.
2019/05/03: If the target creature has less than 4 toughness, <Enter the God-Eternals> still deals 4 damage to it and you'll gain 4 life.
2019/05/03: If the target creature is no longer a legal target as the spell resolves but the player is a legal target, no creature is dealt damage and you gain no life, but the target player still moves the top cards of their library and you still amass 4.
2019/05/03: If the target player is no longer a legal target as the spell resolves but the creature is a legal target, the creature is dealt damage, you gain that much life, and you amass 4. No player moves cards from their library.
2019/05/03: If both targets are no longer legal targets as the spell tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You don't amass 4.
2019/05/03: If the target creature is dealt lethal damage by <Enter the God-Eternals>, it'll still be on the battlefield while you gain life, the target player moves cards, and you amass 4. Any abilities it has may affect these actions and may trigger on them.
2019/05/03: Abilities that trigger while <Enter the God-Eternals> is resolving or that trigger as the target creature dies are all put onto the stack after the spell has finished resolving and the target creature has (if lethally damaged) died.
2019/05/03: Army is a new creature type. It's possible to control a nontoken Army (perhaps a creature with the changeling ability) and, through combinations of other cards, it's possible to control multiple Army tokens. When instructed to amass, you may put +1/+1 counters on any of your Army creatures, and you may choose a different one each time.
2019/05/03: If you don't control an Army, the Zombie Army token that you create enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield, such as that of Mentor of the Meek, will see the token enter as a 0/0 creature before it gets +1/+1 counters.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: The spell may have any other targets in addition to a creature you control.
2019/05/03: If an instant or sorcery spell you cast that targets your creature doesn't resolve for any reason (either because another spell or ability counters it or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), it won't be exiled. You won't return it to your hand.
2019/05/03: If an instant or sorcery spell's own effect instructs you to exile it or put it anywhere else, it won't try to be put into your graveyard or exiled with Feather's effect, so you won't return it to your hand.
2019/05/03: If another replacement effect instructs you to exile an instant or sorcery spell, such as that of Dreadhorde Arcanist or the flashback keyword, you may choose to apply Feather's replacement effect first. If you do, Feather's delayed triggered ability will return that card to your hand.
2019/05/03: If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that you don't own, it won't try to be put into your graveyard, so you won't exile it with Feather's effect or return it to your hand.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: Some spells instruct you to "copy target instant or sorcery spell." Because a spell is never a legal target for itself, you can't cast such a spell targeting itself to create a loop that causes Ral's first ability over and over.

2019/05/03: If the spell that's copied has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can). The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
2019/06/14: If an effect copies a card rather than a spell (such as that of God-Eternal Kefnet), this doesn't cause Ral's first ability to trigger. That ability will trigger if you cast the copy, however.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying, trample
When Roalesk, Apex Hybrid enters the battlefield, put two +1/+1 counters on another target creature you control.
When Roalesk dies, proliferate, then proliferate again. (Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there. Then do it again.)</CardText>
<Artist>Svetlin Velinov</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: You proliferate twice all while Roalesk's last ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two proliferations, and no player may choose to take actions.
2019/05/03: If Roalesk would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. However, if you save Roalesk this way, it doesn't die and you won't proliferate.
2019/05/03: The War of the Spark set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/05/03: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2019/05/03: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/05/03: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

2019/05/03: The permanent types are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Supertypes, like legendary, aren't permanent types. For example, you can't exchange control of a legendary creature with a legendary planeswalker.</Rulings>

-3: Return target card from your graveyard to your hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent or discard a card, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent or to discard a card, you can't take that option.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability an opponent controls states that something happens unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Mogis, God of Slaughter does) or discard a card (as Painful Quandary does), you can't choose to sacrifice or discard. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does) or discard a card unless you perform an action, you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since the spell or ability can't cause you to sacrifice any permanents or discard cards.
2019/05/03: Tamiyo's ability affects sacrifices, but not any other ways permanents can leave the battlefield. It won't stop a creature from dying due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability your opponent controls reduces your maximum hand size, Tamiyo's first ability won't stop you from discarding cards when the game rules cause you to discard during your cleanup step.
2019/05/03: If Tamiyo has 3 loyalty, you can't activate her last ability to return her to your hand. She won't be in your graveyard while you're choosing targets for the ability.</Rulings>

<CardText>Blast Zone enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it.

{X}{X}, {T}: Put X charge counters on Blast Zone.
{3}, {T}, Sacrifice Blast Zone: Destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Blast Zone.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Ostrowski</Artist>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: An activation cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {6} to activate <Blast Zone>'s ability.
2019/05/03: Tokens that aren't a copy of something else don't have a mana cost. Anything without a mana cost normally has a converted mana cost of 0.
2019/05/03: If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/05/03: The War of the Spark set doesn't include any ways for players to have counters, but some cards in other sets say that a player "gets" a counter of a certain kind. Notably, emblems aren't counters.
2019/05/03: You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
2019/05/03: You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
2019/05/03: Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
2019/05/03: If a spell or ability puts counters on a player or permanent and then instructs you to proliferate, choosing that player or permanent will give that player or permanent another of those counters.
2019/05/03: Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.</Rulings>

{4}: Mobilized District becomes a 3/3 Citizen creature with vigilance until end of turn. It's still a land. This ability costs {1} less to activate for each legendary creature and planeswalker you control.</CardText>
<Flavor>Sometimes the strongest weapon you can hold in your hand is another hand.</Flavor>
<Rulings>2019/05/03: If you control four or more legendary permanents that are creatures and/or planeswalkers, the last ability of <Mobilized District> costs no mana to activate. A legendary planeswalker that's also a creature reduces this cost by only {1}.
2019/05/03: If <Mobilized District> becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or activate its mana ability.
2019/05/03: An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if <Mobilized District> has been made a 0/0 creature with nine +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 12/12 Citizen creature that's still a land.</Rulings>
