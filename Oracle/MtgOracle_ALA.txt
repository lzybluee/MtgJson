<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
2008/10/01: If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
2008/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
2008/10/01: Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared.
2008/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until end of turn. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
2008/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.</Rulings>

<Artist>Volkan Baǵa</Artist>
<Multiverseid>174859</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Emblems behave similarly to enchantments: They have an ability that, in a general sense, continually affects the game. The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability.
2013/07/01: Lethal damage and effects that say "destroy" won't cause a permanent with indestructible to be put into the graveyard. However, a permanent with indestructible can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed, if it's a creature whose toughness is 0 or less, or if it's an Aura that's either unattached or attached to something illegal.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: This effect takes into account spells that were cast earlier in the turn that <Ethersworn Canonist> entered the battlefield, including any spells still on the stack. However, any spells on the stack as <Ethersworn Canonist> enters the battlefield have already been cast by that point, so they're not affected by it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: <Invincible Hymn> checks the number of cards in your library just once: when it resolves. It doesn't continuously modify your life total as your library size changes.
2008/10/01: For your life total to become the appropriate number, you actually gain or lose the necessary amount of life. For example, if your life total is 20 and your library has thirty-two cards in it when <Invincible Hymn> resolves, <Invincible Hymn> will cause you to gain 12 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with <Invincible Hymn> accordingly.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Invincible Hymn> will essentially set your team's life total to the number of cards in your library. For example, suppose your team has 8 life and you have thirty cards in your library. Your life total (being the same as your team's life total) changes from 8 life to 30 life, for a net gain of 22 life. Your team's life total becomes 30 (22 + 8).</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Zug</Artist>
<Multiverseid>174985</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Artist>E. M. Gist</Artist>
<Multiverseid>176456</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: <Gather Specimens> isn't targeted. It affects creatures that would enter the battlefield under any opponent's control.
2008/10/01: <Gather Specimens> affects both token creatures and nontoken creatures. It affects creatures that would enter the battlefield by any means. This includes, of course, creature spells that resolve. It also includes creatures put onto the battlefield as a result of a resolving spell (such as Call of the Herd or Zombify), resolving ability (such as Verdant Force's ability or Doomed Necromancer's ability), cost (such as Varchild's War-Riders's cumulative upkeep cost), replacement effect (such as the one created by Words of Wilding), or any other means.
2008/10/01: If a creature spell controlled by an opponent would resolve, it resolves, but the creature enters the battlefield under your control instead of the opponent's control. Choices made when casting that spell (such as whether it was kicked or the value of X in the spell's cost) are remembered. Any "enters the battlefield" triggered abilities will trigger after the creature is on the battlefield under your control.
2008/10/01: The <Gather Specimens> replacement effect is applied before any other replacement effects that would also modify how the creature enters the battlefield. These are usually worded "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with." For example, if your <Gather Specimens> has resolved, then the following things are true: -- If a creature with devour would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control, you choose and sacrifice your creatures as it enters the battlefield under your control. -- If Voice of All would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control, you choose a color as it enters the battlefield under your control. -- If Clone would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control, you choose which creature it copies as it enters the battlefield under your control. -- If a Wizard would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control and that player controls Sage of Fables, the Wizard will not enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it as it enters the battlefield under your control. -- If a Wizard would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control and you control Sage of Fables, the Wizard will enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it as it enters the battlefield under your control.
2008/10/01: <Gather Specimens> won't retroactively change the control of creatures that have already enter the battlefield that turn.
2008/10/01: Some effects that put creatures onto the battlefield continue to affect those creatures later on. Although <Gather Specimens> changes whose control the creature enters the battlefield under, the rest of the effect works as normal. For example, if your opponent activates a creature card's unearth ability and you cast <Gather Specimens>, that creature enters the battlefield under your control, but the rest of the unearth ability is unchanged. The creature has haste. It's exiled at the beginning of the end step. If it would leave the battlefield, it's exiled instead of being put anywhere else.
2008/10/01: If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield also creates a delayed triggered ability, <Gather Specimens> doesn't change who controls that ability. In the unearth example above, your opponent controls the ability that exiles the creature at the beginning of the end step. On the other hand, if the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield grants a triggered ability to the creature (with "gains" or "has"), the player who controls the creature at the time the ability triggers will be the player who controls that ability. For example, if your opponent casts Makeshift Mannequin and you cast <Gather Specimens> in response, the creature will return to the battlefield under your control with a mannequin counter and it will have the ability "When this creature becomes the target of a spell or ability, sacrifice it." If the ability triggers, you'll control it, so you'll have to sacrifice the creature.
2008/10/01: If two or more players have each cast <Gather Specimens> during the same turn and a creature would enter the battlefield, the creature's would-be controller (the controller of the creature spell, for example) chooses one of the applicable <Gather Specimens> to apply. Then the new would-be controller of the creature repeats this process among the remaining <Gather Specimens>, and so on, until there are no more possible <Gather Specimens> effects to apply.
2008/10/01: The above procedure means that if two opposing players have each cast <Gather Specimens> during the same turn and a creature would enter the battlefield under the control of one of them, it really will enter the battlefield under that player's control. (The creature would enter the battlefield under player A's control, so player B's <Gather Specimens> affects it. Now that creature would enter the battlefield under player B's control, so player A's <Gather Specimens> affects it. Each replacement effect has now been used, so the creature will enter the battlefield under player A's control.)</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger.

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The first ability can target zero, one, or two artifacts. You may activate it with no targets just to put a loyalty counter on Tezzeret.
2008/10/01: For the second ability, you choose the value of X when you activate it. You don't look through your library until the ability resolves. (In other words, you can't look through your library, decide what artifact card you want, and then determine what X is.) You can't choose an X that's greater than the number of loyalty counters on Tezzeret.
2008/10/01: The third ability affects all artifacts you control, including artifacts that are already creatures.
2008/10/01: The third ability causes artifacts you control to become creatures in addition to their other card types.
2009/10/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature is subject to the "summoning sickness" rule: It can only attack, and its {T} abilities can only be activated, if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn.
2009/10/01: The effect from the ability overwrites other effects that set power and/or toughness if and only if those effects existed before the ability resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after the ability resolves. Effects that switch the creature's power and toughness are always applied after any other power or toughness changing effects, including this one, regardless of the order in which they are created.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast. Also unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact has a color in all zones. It will interact with cards that care about color. Other than that, a colored artifact behaves just like any other artifact. It will interact as normal with any card that cares about artifacts, such as Shatter or Arcbound Ravager.
2009/10/01: If you activate the ability multiple times during the same turn, <Vectis Silencers> will gain multiple instances of deathtouch; however, multiple instances of deathtouch are redundant. A creature dealt damage by a source with deathtouch is destroyed as a state-based action the next time they are checked, so a single regeneration effect will save it regardless of how many instances of deathtouch the source had at the time damage was dealt.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: The first ability exiles two cards in your graveyard as a cost. You can't activate this ability unless you have at least two cards in your graveyard. Exiling those two cards can't be responded to.
2008/10/01: The second ability prevents all damage that would be dealt to you, regardless of how many cards are in your graveyard. For example, if you have three cards in your graveyard and would be dealt 5 damage, <Immortal Coil> prevents all 5 damage and exiles all the cards in your graveyard.
2008/10/01: The third ability checks whether your graveyard is empty only at the time it triggers. Putting a card into your graveyard after that doesn't help. You'll lose the game when the ability resolves.

<Artist>Thomas M. Baxa</Artist>
<Multiverseid>176444</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The only difference between a colored artifact and a colorless artifact is, obviously, its color. Unlike most artifacts, a colored artifact requires colored mana to cast.

This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.

If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

If a creature with devour and another creature are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, the creature with devour can't devour that other creature. The creature with devour also can't devour itself.
2008/10/01: If multiple creatures with devour are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you may use each one's devour ability. A creature you already control can be devoured by only one of them, however. (In other words, you can't sacrifice the same creature to satisfy multiple devour abilities.)

2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.
2008/10/01: You can cycle this card even if there are no targets for the triggered ability. That's because the cycling ability itself has no targets.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>174845</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.
2017/03/14: <Scourge Devil>'s triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves, including <Scourge Devil> itself. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The first ability has an "intervening 'if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you control a creature with power 5 or greater as your end step begins, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you don't control a creature with power 5 or greater by the time it resolves. (It doesn't have to be the same creature as the one that allowed the ability to trigger.) Power-boosting effects that last "until end of turn" will still be in effect when this kind of ability triggers and resolves. An ability like this will trigger a maximum of once per turn, no matter how many applicable creatures you control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: The ability checks that creature's power only once: when that creature enters the battlefield. The trigger checks a creature's initial power upon being put on the battlefield, so it will take into account counters that it enters the battlefield with and static abilities that may give it a continuous power boost once it's on the battlefield (such as the one on Glorious Anthem). After the creature is already on the battlefield, boosting its power with a spell (such as Giant Growth), activated ability, or triggered ability won't allow this ability to trigger; it's too late by then. Once the ability triggers, it will resolve no matter what the creature's power may become while the ability is on the stack.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: You may sacrifice only creatures that are already on the battlefield. If a creature with devour and another creature are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, the creature with devour can't devour that other creature. The creature with devour also can't devour itself.

2008/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger.

2008/10/01: Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared.
2008/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until end of turn.

2008/10/01: One of the piles may have zero cards in it if the opponent wishes.
2008/10/01: You play cards from the chosen pile as part of the resolution of <Brilliant Ultimatum>. You may play them in any order. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other play restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat"). You play all of the cards you like, putting land onto the battlefield and spells on the stack, then <Brilliant Ultimatum> finishes resolving and is put into your graveyard. The spells you cast this way will then resolve as normal, one at a time, in the opposite order that they were put on the stack.
2008/10/01: You can play a land card from the chosen pile only if it's your turn (which it probably is, since <Brilliant Ultimatum> is a sorcery) and you haven't yet played a land this turn. That means that if there are two lands in the chosen pile, you'll be able to play a maximum of one of them.
2008/10/01: If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs, such as conspire costs and kicker costs.
2008/10/01: The cards in the pile that wasn't chosen remain exiled. Likewise, any cards in the chosen pile that you can't play or you choose not to play remain exiled.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: This spell has no targets. You don't choose five permanents you control until <Clarion Ultimatum> resolves. If you control fewer than five permanents at that time, choose each permanent you do control.
2008/10/01: The five permanents you choose must all be different. However, some of them may have the same name as one another. For example, you may choose two Empyrial Archangels and three Plains. If you do, you search your library for up to two more Empyrial Archangels and up to three more Plains and put them onto the battlefield tapped.
2008/10/01: If you choose a permanent whose name has been changed by an effect (for example, a Clone that's copying another creature), you'll search for a card with the new name, not one with the original name. Note that changing a land's subtype doesn't change its name.
2008/10/01: If you choose a permanent with no name, such as a face-down creature, no card in your library can be found with that name.
2008/10/01: You make just one search. (This could matter for cards like Aven Mindcensor, for example.)
2008/10/01: The cards all enter the battlefield at the same time. If one of the cards that's entering the battlefield is an Aura, it must enter the battlefield attached to a permanent already on the battlefield. It can't enter the battlefield attached to another permanent entering the battlefield via <Clarion Ultimatum>. If an Aura can't enter the battlefield this way, it remains in your library.
2008/10/01: If you find a card that isn't a permanent card while searching (for example, you chose an Illusion token and find the split card Illusion/Reality), that card remains in your library.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/03/14: <Cruel Ultimatum>'s only target is an opponent. You don't choose which creature card in your graveyard you'll return to your hand until <Cruel Ultimatum> resolves.
2017/03/14: All of the actions for <Cruel Ultimatum> are performed sequentially, in the order listed. Earlier actions may affect how you perform later actions. For example, if the opponent sacrifices a creature that they control but you own, it will end up in your graveyard. When <Cruel Ultimatum> lets you return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, you can choose that one.
2017/03/14: If, as <Cruel Ultimatum> begins to resolve, your opponent's life total is 5 or less and you have two or fewer cards in your library, the game will result in a draw. Your opponent's life total will drop to 0 or less, but <Cruel Ultimatum> must finish resolving completely before state-based actions are performed. You'll then be forced to draw three cards and fail to draw one. When state-based actions are finally performed, you and your opponent will both lose the game at the same time, which means the game is a draw.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mitch Cotie</Artist>
<Multiverseid>176447</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you activate a card's unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
2008/10/01: Activating a creature card's unearth ability isn't the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul) will not.
2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.</Rulings>

You can do it later in combat (including all the way up through the end of combat step) as long as there's still a creature attacking you. Of course, if you cast <Qasali Ambusher> later than the declare attackers step, it won't be able to block.

The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
2008/10/01: If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
2008/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
2008/10/01: Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared.
2008/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until end of turn. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
2008/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
2008/10/01: Unearth grants haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
2008/10/01: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that's causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence.

2008/10/01: You don't choose the new target for the spell until <Swerve> resolves. You must change the target if possible. However, you can't change the target to an illegal target. If there are no legal targets, the target isn't changed. It doesn't matter if the original target of that spell has somehow become illegal.
2008/10/01: If you cast <Swerve> on a spell that targets a spell on the stack (like Cancel does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself. You can, however, change that spell's target to <Swerve>. If you do, that spell won't resolve when it tries to resolve because <Swerve> will have left the stack by then.
2008/10/01: If a spell targets multiple things, you can't target it with <Swerve>, even if all but one of those targets has become illegal.
2008/10/01: If a spell targets the same player or object multiple times, you can't target it with <Swerve>.
2010/03/01: An Aura spell on the stack targets the object or player which it will enchant upon entering the battlefield. Thus, an Aura spell is a "spell with a single target", which means you may use <Swerve> to change that target. Doing so will cause it to enter the battlefield enchanting the new target rather than the original one.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger.

2008/10/01: If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
2008/10/01: Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
2008/10/01: Exalted abilities will resolve before blockers are declared.
2008/10/01: Exalted bonuses last until end of turn. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
2008/10/01: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.</Rulings>

<CardText>If you would lose the game, instead shuffle your hand, your graveyard, and all permanents you own into your library, then draw seven cards and your life total becomes 20.</CardText>
<Flavor>It shows not what you are but what you were.</Flavor>
<Artist>Ash Wood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>174818</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: <Lich's Mirror> has no effect if you concede the game. If you concede, you'll lose.
2008/10/01: If you can't lose the game (for example, you control a Platinum Angel), <Lich's Mirror> won't do anything.
2008/10/01: <Lich's Mirror> shuffles permanents you own into your library, regardless of who controls them.
2008/10/01: <Lich's Mirror> shuffles tokens you own into your library, too. The tokens you own will leave play. However, there's no point to physically shuffling tokens into your library because you can't draw them as part of <Lich's Mirror>'s effect and they'll cease to exist immediately afterwards.
2008/10/01: Any abilities that trigger when the permanents leave the battlefield will be put on the stack after <Lich's Mirror>'s entire effect has been applied.
2008/10/01: <Lich's Mirror> doesn't affect spells on the stack, cards that have been exiled, or permanents you control but don't own. They'll stay where they are. Spells on the stack will then resolve as normal.
2008/10/01: Although <Lich's Mirror> has you draw a hand of seven cards and sets your life total to 20, this isn't a game restart. You can't take a mulligan if you don't like your new hand of cards.
2008/10/01: <Lich's Mirror> replaces the game-loss event if you would lose the game in the following ways: -- As a state-based action for having 0 or less life. -- As a state-based action for having tried to draw a card from an empty library since the last time state-based actions were checked. -- As a state-based action for having ten or more poison counters (though this isn't that helpful; see below). -- Because an ability (such as the one from Immortal Coil) states that you do so.
2008/10/01: As part of <Lich's Mirror>'s effect, it typically shuffles itself into your library. If it does, that means that if you'd lose the game *again* immediately after its effect is finished, it can't help you a second time. This can occur in a few different ways. For example: -- You have ten or more poison counters. <Lich's Mirror> doesn't remove poison counters. If you'd lose the game this way, you'll do what <Lich's Mirror> says, then you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked. -- Your life total is 0 or less and an effect says that you can't gain life. Since your life total can't be raised, it stays at whatever it is rather than becoming 20, and you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked. -- The number of nontoken permanents you own plus the number of cards in your hand, graveyard, and library is less than seven. When you try to draw seven cards as part of <Lich's Mirror>'s effect, you'll be unable to complete at least one of those draws and you'll lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked. -- You control *but don't own* a permanent such as Immortal Coil with a triggered ability that causes you to lose the game when a certain game state happens (also known as a "state trigger"), and the condition that causes the "lose the game" ability to trigger hasn't changed. If you owned the permanent, <Lich's Mirror> would shuffle it into your library. In this case, however, it remains on the battlefield and its ability will trigger again.
2008/10/01: If you control *but don't own* <Lich's Mirror>, <Lich's Mirror> itself will still be on the battlefield after its effect is finished. If you would lose the game again for any of the reasons above, <Lich's Mirror> has its effect again . . . and again . . . and again. An involuntary infinite loop will be created, and the game will end in a draw. (In the case of the triggered ability example given last in the list above, it's possible that a player could cause the loop to end while the ability is on the stack. None of the loops caused by state-based actions can be stopped at all.)
2008/10/01: If all the players remaining in a game would lose simultaneously but one of them controls <Lich's Mirror>, that player does what <Lich's Mirror> says instead of losing, and everyone else loses. As a result, the controller of <Lich's Mirror> wins the game because all of their opponents have lost. (If <Lich's Mirror> weren't in the picture, then the game would be a draw.)
2008/10/01: If a spell causes you to lose the game the next time state-based actions are checked (by dealing damage to you greater than your life total, for example), that spell will already be in the graveyard by the time <Lich's Mirror>'s effect happens. If it's in your graveyard, it will be shuffled into your library.
2008/10/01: If, during a check of state-based actions, you'd lose the game at the same time a creature you own would be put into your graveyard (due to an Earthquake for 10 or combat damage dealt to both you and the creature, for example), that creature's controller has a choice to make. The state-based actions rule is trying to simultaneously (a) shuffle that creature card into your library (due to <Lich's Mirror>'s replacement effect) and (b) put it into your graveyard. Only one of those things can happen. The creature's controller chooses which one. If the creature is put into your graveyard, it isn't shuffled into your library. Abilities that trigger when that creature is put into a graveyard will trigger only if that option is chosen.
2008/10/01: If, during a check of state-based actions, you'd lose the game for multiple reasons (for example, if you were at 1 life and had one card in your library, then Night's Whisper caused you to draw two cards and lose 2 life), a single <Lich's Mirror> will replace all of them. You'll do what <Lich's Mirror> says just once.
2008/10/01: For your life total to become 20, you actually gain or lose the necessary amount of life. Keep in mind that you may have a negative life total when this happens. For example, if your life total is -4 when you would lose the game, <Lich's Mirror>'s effect will cause you to gain 24 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
2008/10/01: <Lich's Mirror> has no effect if a spell or ability (such as the one from Helix Pinnacle) states that a player "wins the game." If a player wins the game, the game ends immediately.
2009/10/01: A token's owner is the player under whose control it entered the battlefield.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, if your team would lose the game and you control <Lich's Mirror>, your team won't lose. Instead, you'll do what <Lich's Mirror> says and your teammate won't do anything. This is true even if the reason your team would lose is because your teammate tried to draw a card with an empty library or was affected by an ability that said they lost the game. Your life total (which is the same as your team's life total) becomes 20. Your team's life total is adjusted by the amount of life you gain or lose as a result of this, which basically means your team's life total becomes 20.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the creature, nor will it copy other effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2008/10/01: The copiable values of the token's characteristics are the same as the copiable values of the characteristics of the creature it's copying, plus haste and "At end of turn, sacrifice this permanent." That means if something becomes a copy of the token, it will also have haste and it will also have to be sacrificed at the end of the turn.
2008/10/01: If the creature that caused <Minion Reflector>'s ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {2}. If you do, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield. That token has the copiable values of the characteristics of that nontoken creature as it last existed on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: That player loses half their life after combat damage has been subtracted from the player's life total. The amount of life the player loses is determined as the triggered ability resolves.

2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, after combat damage is dealt, <Quietus Spike> looks at that player's life total (which is the same as the team's life total) when determining how much life the team will lose, which basically means the team's life total is halved. Here's an example of the math: The team has 19 life, so the player has 19 life. <Quietus Spike> causes the team to lose 10 life (19 divided by 2, rounded up).
