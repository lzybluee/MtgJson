<CardText>Choose a color. White creatures you control gain protection from the chosen color until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Kekai Kotaki</Artist>
<Rulings>2009/10/01: You choose a color as <Brave the Elements> resolves. Once the color is chosen, it's too late for players to respond.
2009/10/01: Only white creatures you control at the time <Brave the Elements> resolves gain the protection ability. Creatures that come under your control later in the turn, or that turn white later in the turn, won't have it.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Prescott</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The cards you put into your hand this way include one nonland card, plus all the land cards on top of it in your library (if any). If the top card of your library is a nonland card, you just get that one.
2010/03/01: If all the cards left in your library are lands, you'll reveal all of them and put them all into your hand.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>RR (2)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Searing Blaze deals 1 damage to target player or planeswalker and 1 damage to target creature that player or that planeswalker's controller controls.
Landfall â€” If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, Searing Blaze deals 3 damage to that player or planeswalker and 3 damage to that creature instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Jaime Jones</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: Whether you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn is checked as this spell resolves, not as you cast it.
2010/03/01: Having more than one land enter the battlefield under your control this turn provides no additional benefit.
2010/03/01: The landfall ability checks for an action that has happened in the past. It doesn't matter if a land that entered the battlefield under your control previously in the turn is still on the battlefield, is still under your control, or is still a land.
2010/03/01: Once the spell resolves, having a land enter the battlefield under your control provides no further benefit.
2010/03/01: The effect of this spell's landfall ability replaces its normal effect. If you had a land enter the battlefield under your control this turn, only the landfall-based effect happens.
2010/03/01: You must choose two targets as you cast <Searing Blaze>: a player and a creature that player controls. If you can't (because there are no creatures on the battlefield, perhaps), then you can't cast the spell.
2010/03/01: If either target is illegal by the time <Searing Blaze> resolves, it still deals damage to the other target.</Rulings>
