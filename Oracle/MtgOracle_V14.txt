<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Burning of Xinye> targets only an opponent. If that player is an illegal target by the time <Burning of Xinye> resolves, the entire spell doesn't resolve.
2009/10/01: The lands that will be destroyed aren't chosen until <Burning of Xinye> resolves.
2009/10/01: A land with a regeneration shield on it will regenerate from <Burning of Xinye>'s destruction effect. However, the spell or ability that creates that shield must be cast or activated before <Burning of Xinye> starts to resolve.
2009/10/01: In a multiplayer game, only lands controlled by two players (you and the targeted opponent) are destroyed. However, <Burning of Xinye> will deal 4 damage to each creature, even those controlled by other players.
2013/07/01: As <Burning of Xinye> resolves, first you destroy four lands you control (all at the same time), then the targeted opponent destroys four lands they control (all at the same time). That player chooses which of their lands to destroy. Neither of you can choose to destroy a land with indestructible.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>386286</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you can choose that same permanent for more than one of the choices if you want to. This makes it possible to select an artifact creature as both your artifact and creature, and then select a land and thereby keep only two cards.
2004/10/04: If you control a permanent with more than one type, you can choose that permanent to be the representative of either type. This makes it possible to have more than one creature (or other permanent type) on the battlefield. For example, if you select a creature for your creature and an artifact creature for your artifact, you get to keep both of these creatures.
2004/10/04: The permanents to save are chosen on resolution. You do not choose them when casting the spell.
2004/10/04: The current player makes their choices before the other player. After both players make choices, all the sacrifices are done simultaneously.
2014/02/01: Each permanent not chosen by a player will be sacrificed. If a permanent has none of the listed types (for example, a Planeswalker with no other types), it can't be chosen.</Rulings>

<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>386288</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: Cycling is an activated ability. Effects that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle or Rings of Brighthearth) will interact with cycling. Effects that interact with spells (such as Remove Soul or Faerie Tauntings) will not.
2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2016/06/08: This spell cares about what mana was spent to pay its total cost, not just what mana was spent to pay the hybrid mana symbol in its cost.
2016/06/08: This spell checks on resolution to see if any mana of the appropriate colors were spent to pay its cost. It doesn't matter how much mana of that color was spent; the effect isn't multiplied.
2016/06/08: If this spell is copied, the copy will not have had any colors of mana paid for it, no matter what colors were spent on the original spell.</Rulings>
