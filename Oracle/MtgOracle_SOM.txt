2011/01/01: Since players who haven't paid {2} can't search, they won't be able to find any cards in a library. The effect applies to all players and all libraries. If a spell or ability's effect has other parts that don't depend on searching for or finding cards, they will still work normally.
2011/01/01: Effects that tell a player to reveal cards from a library or look at cards from the top of a library will still work. Only effects that use the word "search" will fail unless a player pays {2}.
2011/01/01: Paying {2} to ignore <Leonin Arbiter>'s effect is a special action. Any player may take this special action any time they have priority. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2011/01/01: Paying {2} doesn't let a player pick up a library and search it — it just allows them to ignore <Leonin Arbiter>'s effect that turn. That player can search a library only if another spell or ability instructs them to do so.
2011/01/01: If a player pays {2}, that enables only them to ignore <Leonin Arbiter>'s effect that turn. Each other player is still affected by it.
2011/01/01: A player who has paid {2} may search any library when instructed to do so that turn, not just their own library.

<Rulings>2011/01/01: Except for its power and toughness, <Quicksilver Gargantuan> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2011/01/01: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be zero.
2011/01/01: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is a Clone), then your <Quicksilver Gargantuan> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied, except for its power and toughness.
2011/01/01: If the chosen creature is a token, your <Quicksilver Gargantuan> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, except for its power and toughness. Your <Quicksilver Gargantuan> is not a token.
2011/01/01: If <Quicksilver Gargantuan> is not a creature (for example, if it entered the battlefield as a copy of an animated land), it will not have the characteristics of power or toughness at all, so it won't be 7/7. If it later becomes a creature, its power and toughness will be determined by the effect that causes it to become a creature; again, it won't be 7/7.
2011/01/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Quicksilver Gargantuan> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2011/01/01: If <Quicksilver Gargantuan> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature (due to Mass Polymorph or Liliana Vess's third ability, for example), <Quicksilver Gargantuan> can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2011/01/01: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Quicksilver Gargantuan> simply enters the battlefield as a 7/7 creature.
2011/06/01: If the chosen creature has a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness, that ability will not be copied. For example, if <Quicksilver Gargantuan> copies a Nightmare, it will not gain the ability that sets its power and toughness to the number of Swamps you control. As such, it will remain a 7/7.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: <Relic Putrescence> may target and may enchant an artifact that's already tapped. It won't do anything until the enchanted artifact changes from being untapped to being tapped.
2011/01/01: When the enchanted artifact becomes tapped, <Relic Putrescence>'s ability triggers. The player who gets the poison counter is the player who, at the time the ability resolves, controls the artifact that became tapped. If that artifact is no longer on the battlefield, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its controller. It doesn't matter whether <Relic Putrescence> is still on the battlefield as the ability resolves, what artifact it's enchanting at that time, who controlled the artifact at the time it became tapped, or who tapped it.
2011/01/01: If the enchanted artifact is tapped as a cost to activate a mana ability, the mana ability resolves immediately, then <Relic Putrescence>'s ability goes on the stack.
2011/01/01: If the enchanted artifact is tapped as a cost to activate an ability that's not a mana ability, <Relic Putrescence>'s ability will go on the stack on top of that activated ability and resolve first.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>212238</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Emblems behave similarly to enchantments: They have an ability that, in a general sense, continually affects the game. The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability.
2011/01/01: Koth's first ability can target any Mountain, including an untapped Mountain and/or a Mountain another player controls.
2011/01/01: If Koth's first ability animates a Mountain that came under your control that turn, it will have "summoning sickness" and be unable to attack. It will also be unable to be tapped to activate an ability with the {T} symbol in its cost, such as the Mountain's mana ability or the ability granted to it by Koth's emblem.
2011/01/01: Loyalty abilities can't be mana abilities. Koth's second ability uses the stack and can be countered or otherwise responded to. Like all loyalty abilities, it can be activated only once per turn, during your main phase, when the stack is empty, and only if no other loyalty abilities of this permanent have been activated this turn.
2011/01/01: Koth's emblem grants an activated ability to each Mountain you control at any given time for the rest of the game. It will continuously check which permanents you control are Mountains to determine what has the ability. For example, a Mountain that comes under your control later in the game will have the ability, while a Mountain you controlled at the time the emblem was created, but that later came under the control of another player, will no longer have the ability.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: If you attack with <Tangle Angler> but a creature you targeted with its activated ability isn't able to block it (for example, because an effect has granted <Tangle Angler> intimidate and the other creature is white), the other creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2011/01/01: Tapped creatures, creatures that can't block as the result of an effect, creatures with unpaid costs to block (such as those from War Cadence), and creatures that aren't controlled by the defending player are exempt from effects that would require them to block. Such creatures can be targeted by <Tangle Angler>'s activated ability, but the requirement to block does nothing.</Rulings>

<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Multiverseid>212240</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Emblems behave similarly to enchantments: They have an ability that, in a general sense, continually affects the game. The primary difference between them is that emblems aren't permanents and don't exist on the battlefield. Nothing in the game can remove an emblem, simply because no other spell or ability references them. Once you get an emblem, you keep it for the rest of the game. Emblems have no color, name, card type, or other characteristics beyond the listed ability.
2011/01/01: The first ability can target any permanent you own, including those another player controls.
2011/01/01: If the first ability exiles a token, that token will cease to exist. It won't return to the battlefield.
2011/01/01: A permanent exiled by the first ability will return to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step even if you no longer control Venser at that time.
2011/01/01: Venser's second ability doesn't lock in what it applies to. That's because the effect states a true thing about creatures, but doesn't actually change the characteristics of those creatures. As a result, all creatures can't be blocked that turn, including creatures you don't control, creatures that weren't on the battlefield at the time the ability resolved, and creatures that have lost all abilities.
2011/01/01: Venser's last ability creates an emblem with a triggered ability. The emblem is the source of the triggered ability. Because emblems are colorless, you can target permanents with protection from white or from blue, for example, with the triggered ability.
2011/01/01: Whenever you cast a spell, the emblem's ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it. It will resolve before the spell does.
2011/01/01: If you control more than one such emblem, each one's ability will trigger separately whenever you cast a spell.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: If the number of charge counters on <Chimeric Mass> changes while it is a creature, its power and toughness will change accordingly.
2011/01/01: If you activate <Chimeric Mass>'s last ability while it has no charge counters on it, it will become a 0/0 creature and be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2011/01/01: Activating the last ability while <Chimeric Mass> is a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to another number, but effects that modify power and/or toughness without directly setting them will still apply.
2011/01/01: For example, say you activate the last ability of a <Chimeric Mass> with three charge counters on it. After it resolves, you cast Giant Growth targeting it. It's now 6/6. Then Diminish ("Target creature becomes 1/1 until end of turn") is cast targeting it. Once Diminish resolves, <Chimeric Mass> would be 4/4. Activating <Chimeric Mass>'s last ability a second time would make it 6/6 again until end of turn.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: Damage from a source with infect is damage in all respects. If the source with infect also has lifelink, damage dealt by that source also causes its controller to gain that much life. Damage from a source with infect can be prevented or redirected. Abilities that trigger on damage being dealt will trigger if a source with infect deals damage, if appropriate.
2011/01/01: If damage from a source with infect that would be dealt to a player is prevented, that player doesn't get poison counters. If damage from a source with infect that would be dealt to a creature is prevented, that creature doesn't get -1/-1 counters.
2011/01/01: Damage from a source with infect affects planeswalkers normally.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: If, during your declare attackers step, <Darksteel Juggernaut> is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having <Darksteel Juggernaut> attack, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

<Rulings>2011/01/01: The creature type "Bird" was inadvertently omitted from each of <Glint Hawk Idol>'s abilities. It has received errata to correct this omission; when either of its abilities resolves, it will become a Bird artifact creature.
2011/01/01: If <Glint Hawk Idol> becomes a creature before you begin a turn with it under your control, it will be affected by "summoning sickness."
2011/01/01: If <Glint Hawk Idol> and another artifact enter the battlefield under your control at the same time, <Glint Hawk Idol>'s first ability will trigger. You may have it become a creature, but since it will be affected by "summoning sickness," it won't be able to attack that turn.
2011/01/01: If either of <Glint Hawk Idol>'s two abilities resolve while it's a creature, that ability will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to another number, but effects that modify power and/or toughness without directly setting them will still apply.
2011/01/01: For example, say one of <Glint Hawk Idol>'s abilities has resolved and it's a 2/2 creature. You cast Giant Growth targeting it. It's now 5/5. Then Diminish ("Target creature becomes 1/1 until end of turn") is cast targeting it. Once Diminish resolves, <Glint Hawk Idol> would be 4/4. Activating <Glint Hawk Idol>'s last ability at this point would make it 5/5 again until end of turn.</Rulings>

<Artist>Matt Cavotta</Artist>
<Watermark>Mirran</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>207883</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: The imprint ability will trigger whenever a nontoken creature is put into any graveyard from the battlefield, not just your graveyard.
2011/01/01: Exiling the card as the first ability resolves is optional. If you choose not to exile it, or you can't exile it because the card has somehow left the graveyard before the ability resolves, the ability simply doesn't do anything as it resolves. Any card currently exiled by <Mimic Vat> remains exiled.
2011/01/01: If multiple nontoken creatures are put into their owners' graveyards from the battlefield at the same time, the imprint ability will trigger that many times. You put the triggered abilities on the stack in any order, so you'll determine in which order they resolve. However, since exiling those cards is optional, and choosing to exile a card this way causes the previously exiled cards to return to their owners' graveyards, the order generally doesn't matter: You'll wind up with at most one of those cards exiled, and the rest will be in the appropriate graveyards.
2011/01/01: You may exile a noncreature card with <Mimic Vat>'s first ability. For example, if a nontoken artifact that's become a creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, <Mimic Vat>'s first ability triggers and you may exile that card.
2011/01/01: The token created by the second ability will be a copy of whatever card is exiled with <Mimic Vat> at the time the ability resolves. This might not be the same card that was exiled with <Mimic Vat> at the time the ability was activated. It also might not be a creature card.
2011/01/01: If the token is a copy of a noncreature card, it will still have haste, though that won't matter unless that token somehow becomes a creature.
2011/01/01: You may activate the second ability even if no card has been exiled with <Mimic Vat>. If no card has been exiled with <Mimic Vat> by the time the ability resolves, no token will be created.
2011/01/01: If the exiled card has {X} in its mana cost (such as Protean Hydra), X is considered to be 0.
2011/01/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the exiled card will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the exiled card will also work.
2011/01/01: The token is exiled at the beginning of the next end step regardless of who controls it at that time, whether the exiled card is still exiled at that time, or whether <Mimic Vat> is still on the battlefield at that time.
2011/01/01: If <Mimic Vat>'s second ability is activated during a turn's end step, the token will be exiled at the beginning of the following turn's end step.
2011/01/01: If the token isn't exiled when the delayed triggered ability resolves (due to Stifle, perhaps), it remains on the battlefield indefinitely. It continues to have haste.
2016/07/13: If a melded permanent dies and triggers <Mimic Vat>'s triggered ability, both of its component cards are exiled. As <Mimic Vat>'s second ability resolves, its controller chooses one of those cards to make a token copy of.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>215069</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: Normally, when a token is created by this ability, it will simply be a <Myr Propagator>, so it'll also have the token-creating ability. (See below for weird exceptions.)
2011/01/01: Here's the detailed version of what happens. As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the <Myr Propagator> it's copying — or, if the <Myr Propagator> whose ability was activated was itself a token, the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield — as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on the <Myr Propagator>, nor will it copy other effects that have changed <Myr Propagator>'s power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2011/01/01: If <Myr Propagator> has left the battlefield by the time its ability resolves, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield. That token has the copiable values of the characteristics of <Myr Propagator> as it last existed on the battlefield.
2011/01/01: Here are the weird exceptions promised above. If any copy effects have affected the <Myr Propagator> whose ability was activated, they're taken into account when the token is created. For example: If <Myr Propagator>'s ability is activated, then <Myr Propagator> temporarily becomes a copy of another creature before its ability resolves (due to Cytoshape, perhaps), the token will be a copy of whatever creature the <Myr Propagator> is currently a copy of. After the turn ends, the Cytoshaped <Myr Propagator> reverts back to what it was, but the token will stay as it is. Also, if the copy ability of a creature (such as Cemetery Puca, perhaps) makes it become a copy of <Myr Propagator> and gain another ability, the token created by this creature's ability will be a <Myr Propagator> with that additional ability.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: <Nim Deathmantle>'s color-changing and type-changing effects override the equipped creature's previous colors and creature types. After <Nim Deathmantle> becomes equipped to a creature, that creature will be a black Zombie, not any other colors or creature types.
2011/01/01: <Nim Deathmantle> causes the equipped creature to be a black Zombie even if it didn't return that creature to the battlefield from the graveyard.
2011/01/01: Once <Nim Deathmantle> becomes unattached from a creature, its color-changing and type-changing effects stop affecting that creature. The creature will no longer be black and will no longer be a Zombie (unless its printed characteristics or some other effects still cause it to be black and/or a Zombie, of course). This is true even if <Nim Deathmantle> returned that creature to the battlefield from the graveyard.
2011/01/01: You choose whether to pay {4} as <Nim Deathmantle>'s second ability resolves. Although players may respond to this ability, once it begins to resolve and you decide whether to pay, it's too late for players to respond.
2011/01/01: If the nontoken creature that caused <Nim Deathmantle>'s second ability to trigger is somehow removed from your graveyard before that ability resolves, you may still pay {4} as it resolves. Even if you do, however, no card will be returned to the battlefield.
2011/01/01: <Nim Deathmantle>'s second ability may return a card it can't equip to the battlefield. For example, if a nontoken artifact that's become a creature is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, <Nim Deathmantle>'s second ability triggers. If you pay {4} as it resolves, you'll return that card to the battlefield. However, <Nim Deathmantle> can't equip it, so <Nim Deathmantle> remains attached to whatever it was already equipping (or, if it was unattached, it remains so). The same is true if a nontoken creature with protection from artifacts is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, for example.
2011/01/01: If multiple nontoken creatures are put into your graveyard from the battlefield at the same time, <Nim Deathmantle>'s second ability triggers that many times. You put the triggered abilities on the stack in any order, so you'll determine in which order they resolve. If you pay {4} more than once, each card you paid {4} for will end up on the battlefield under your control, and <Nim Deathmantle> will end up attached to the last card that returned to the battlefield this way that it could equip.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>215092</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: The ability doesn't prevent damage. Rather, it changes the results of that damage. For example, if a creature with lifelink deals damage to you, you won't lose any life, but its controller will still gain that much life. Similarly, if a creature you control with lifelink deals damage to another player, that player will lose life but you won't gain any life. Notably, if a creature with infect deals damage to you, you'll get that many poison counters.
2011/01/01: Abilities that trigger whenever damage is dealt to you will still trigger because that damage is still dealt, even though your life total doesn't change as a result.
2011/01/01: Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
2011/01/01: You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life.
2011/01/01: If a cost would include causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
2011/01/01: Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other effect won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life. The same is true for events that would replace having you lose life with some other effect.
2011/01/01: Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2011/01/01: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number that's different than your current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything.
2011/01/01: If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.
2011/01/01: The ability won't preclude you from losing the game. It just precludes your life total from changing.</Rulings>

<CardText>When Precursor Golem enters the battlefield, create two 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature tokens.

<Watermark>Mirran</Watermark>
<Multiverseid>206348</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: The second ability triggers whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell that targets only one Golem and no other object or player. That Golem can be <Precursor Golem> itself, one of the Golem tokens it created, or any other Golem. It doesn't matter who controls the Golem.
2011/01/01: If an instant or sorcery spell has multiple targets, but it's targeting the same Golem with all of them (such as Agony Warp targeting the same Golem twice), <Precursor Golem>'s last ability will trigger.
2011/01/01: Any Golem that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by <Precursor Golem>'s second ability.
2011/01/01: The controller of the spell that caused <Precursor Golem>'s second ability to trigger also controls all the copies. That player chooses the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and will resolve last.
2011/01/01: The copies that <Precursor Golem>'s second ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like <Precursor Golem>'s second ability itself) won't trigger.
2011/01/01: If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode. Their controller can't choose a different one.
2011/01/01: If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Fireball does), the copies have the same value of X.
2011/01/01: The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: If <Prototype Portal> has left the battlefield by the time its second ability resolves, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of the exiled card. On the other hand, if <Prototype Portal> is still on the battlefield at this time but there is no exiled card (because, perhaps, Riftsweeper's ability caused the exiled card to be put into its owner's library), no token is created.
2011/01/01: You don't choose the value of {X}. Rather, the value of X is defined by the activated ability.
2011/01/01: If the exiled card has {X} in its mana cost (such as Chalice of the Void), that X is considered to be 0. The {X} in <Prototype Portal>'s activation cost takes this into account, though it may be greater than 0 if the exiled card has other mana symbols in its mana cost (such as Riptide Replicator).
2011/01/01: You may not activate the second ability if no card has been exiled with <Prototype Portal>. In that case, the value of {X} is undefined and can't be paid.
2011/01/01: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the exiled card will trigger when the token is put onto the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the exiled card will also work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/01/01: As <Ratchet Bomb>'s last ability resolves, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine how many charge counters were on it.
2011/01/01: <Ratchet Bomb>'s second ability destroys only those nonland permanents whose converted mana cost is exactly equal to the number of charge counters on <Ratchet Bomb>. It doesn't matter who controls them.
2011/01/01: If <Ratchet Bomb>'s second ability is activated while it has no charge counters on it, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2011/01/01: If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: If the affected artifact is untapped by some other spell or ability, <Rust Tick>'s effect will not end. If you keep <Rust Tick> tapped, and that artifact becomes tapped again, <Rust Tick> will continue to prevent it from being untapped during its controller's untap step.
2011/01/01: <Rust Tick> doesn't track the artifact's controller. If the affected artifact changes controllers, <Rust Tick> will prevent it from being untapped during its new controller's untap step.
2011/01/01: If <Rust Tick> untaps or leaves the battlefield, its effect will end. This has no immediate visible effect on the affected artifact. (It doesn't untap immediately, for example.) The artifact will just untap as normal during its controller's next untap step.

2011/01/01: Spells you cast that share multiple card types with the exiled card still cost just {2} less to cast. They don't get a greater cost reduction.
2011/01/01: <Semblance Anvil> takes the total cost to cast a spell into account, not just its mana cost. This includes additional costs (such as kicker) and alternative costs (such as evoke). It also includes cost increases from other sources (such as Lodestone Golem's ability).
2011/01/01: <Semblance Anvil> won't affect the part of a spell's cost represented by colored mana symbols. For example, a spell that normally costs {1}{U} to cast would cost {U} if it shared a card type with the exiled card.
2011/01/01: <Semblance Anvil> can reduce the amount you pay for a spell's cost that includes {X}. For example, Blaze is a sorcery that costs {X}{R}. If the card exiled with <Semblance Anvil> is a sorcery, and you want to cast Blaze with X equal to 5, you'll have to pay only {3}{R}. This is true even if the ability states that {X} must be paid with a certain color of mana (as Drain Life does).
