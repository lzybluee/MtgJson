<Rulings>2015/11/04: The tokens created by the myriad ability enter the battlefield tapped even though they'll have vigilance.
2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.
2015/11/04: If the defending player is your only opponent, no tokens are put onto the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You choose whether each token is attacking the player or a planeswalker they control as the token is created.
2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else. It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If myriad creates more than one token for any given player (due to an effect such as the one Doubling Season creates), you may choose separately for each token whether it's attacking the player or a planeswalker they control.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: If the third mode is chosen multiple times, each of those modes represents a separate life-gaining event. For example, if the third mode is chosen three times, and you control Karlov of the Ghost Council (a creature with the ability "Whenever you gain life, put two +1/+1 counters on Karlov of the Ghost Council."), Karlov's ability will trigger three times, for a total of six +1/+1 counters.
2015/11/04: You choose the modes as you cast the spell. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/11/04: If a mode requires a target, you can select that mode only if there's a legal target available. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes you don't choose. Each time you select that mode, you can choose a different target, or you can choose the same target.
2015/11/04: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of a Confluence in the order they are written. If the same mode is chosen more than once, you choose their relative order as you cast the spell.
2015/11/04: No player can cast spells or activate abilities in between the modes of a resolving spell.
2015/11/04: If a Confluence is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/11/04: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Confluence resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: <Aethersnatch> can target any spell, even one without targets.
2015/11/04: If you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell, it will be put into its owner's graveyard as it resolves.
2015/11/04: You may change any or none of the spell's targets. If you change a target, you must choose a legal target for the spell. If you can't, you must leave the target unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). Notably, if you were originally chosen as a "target opponent" for a spell you gain control with <Aethersnatch>, you are now an illegal target as you aren't your own opponent.
2015/11/04: Combat damage dealt by a commander is tracked without regard to who controlled the commander at the time it dealt damage. For example, say a commander deals 10 combat damage to a player, leaves the battlefield, is recast, and you gain control of it with <Aethersnatch>. If it deals another 11 combat damage to that same player, they will lose the game.

<Multiverseid>405241</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: The activated ability <Gigantoplasm> gives itself becomes part of its copiable values. Unless the ability is overwritten by another copy effect, a creature that's a copy of <Gigantoplasm> will have that ability.
2015/11/04: However, the effect of that ability isn't copiable. That is, if <Gigantoplasm> is a copy of a creature with base power and toughness 2/2 and you activate its ability making it a 4/4 creature, another creature that becomes a copy of <Gigantoplasm> will have base power and toughness 2/2.
2015/11/04: <Gigantoplasm> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, etc.
2015/11/04: If <Gigantoplasm> isn't a creature (perhaps because it copied a land that had temporarily become a creature), you can still activate the ability "{X}: This creature has base power and toughness X/X." However, this ability won't have any effect, and it won't turn <Gigantoplasm> into a creature.
2015/11/04: The activated ability overwrites all previous effects that set <Gigantoplasm>'s base power and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set its base power and/or toughness that start to apply after the ability resolves (including ones created by subsequent activations of the ability) will overwrite the effect of the ability.
2015/11/04: Effects that modify <Gigantoplasm>'s power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem, will apply to <Gigantoplasm> no matter when they started applying. The same is true for counters that affect its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2015/11/04: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0. The ability that <Gigantoplasm> gives itself doesn't affect an {X} in its mana cost.
2015/11/04: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Gigantoplasm>), then <Gigantoplasm> enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature was copying (plus any abilities it gained as part of the copy process, if applicable).
2015/11/04: If the chosen creature is a token, <Gigantoplasm> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. <Gigantoplasm> isn't a token, even if it's copying one.
2015/11/04: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Gigantoplasm> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
2015/11/04: If <Gigantoplasm> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2015/11/04: You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, <Gigantoplasm> enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.</Rulings>

2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield blocking, they were never declared as blockers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature blocks won't trigger. If there are any costs to have a creature block, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: If the tokens aren't creatures (perhaps because the attacking creature was an animated land), they'll enter the battlefield but they won't be blocking. Attacking creatures that weren't otherwise blocked will remain unblocked.

2015/11/04: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.

<Rulings>2015/11/04: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2015/11/04: You choose the modes as you cast the spell. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/11/04: If a mode requires a target, you can select that mode only if there's a legal target available. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes you don't choose. Each time you select that mode, you can choose a different target, or you can choose the same target.
2015/11/04: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of a Confluence in the order they are written. If the same mode is chosen more than once, you choose their relative order as you cast the spell.
2015/11/04: No player can cast spells or activate abilities in between the modes of a resolving spell.
2015/11/04: If a Confluence is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/11/04: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Confluence resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

<Artist>Alisa Lee</Artist>
<Multiverseid>405127</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2015/11/04: Damage dealt to Anya is tracked even if Anya has indestructible. For example, if Anya is dealt what would be lethal damage and Anya loses indestructible (perhaps because each opponent's life total is too high), it will be destroyed the next time state-based actions are performed. However, the check for whether a creature dealt damage by a source with deathtouch is destroyed happens only the first time that state-based actions are performed after that damage-dealing event.
2015/11/04: If damage is dealt to Anya and to your opponents at the same time, Anya may gain indestructible and/or extra toughness before state-based actions are checked. Similarly, if damage is dealt to Anya by a source with lifelink controlled by an opponent, Anya may lose indestructible and/or toughness before state-based actions are checked.
2015/11/04: If a player's starting life total is odd (Commander Vanguard? Sweet.), half that player's life total will be a fraction, and that's okay. For example, if an opponent's starting life total is 41, half that number is 20 ½. If that player's life total is 20 or less, Anya will have indestructible.</Rulings>

2015/11/04: The term "defending player" in the myriad rules (or any other ability of an attacking creature) refers to the player the creature with myriad was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat, or the controller of the planeswalker the creature was attacking at the time it became an attacking creature this combat.

2015/11/04: Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking, they were never declared as attackers. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger, including the myriad ability of the tokens. If there any costs to have a creature attack, those costs won't apply to the tokens.
2015/11/04: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.

2015/11/04: If your commander isn't in the command zone (or you're not playing Commander) as the last ability resolves, nothing happens.
2016/11/08: If you have two commanders with the partner ability in the command zone, <Command Beacon>'s effect puts one of your choice into your hand, not both.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>405121</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/07/01: The ability doesn't trigger until the enchantment enters the battlefield. This means that, for example, you can't cast an Aura with enchant creature if there are no legal targets available, hoping to enchant the Cat token. <Ajani's Chosen> itself, however, may be a legal target for the Aura.
2013/07/01: If you cast an Aura targeting an opponent or a permanent controlled by an opponent, you control that Aura when it enters the battlefield. The ability of <Ajani's Chosen> will trigger.
2013/07/01: You may attach the Aura to the token only if it can legally enchant that token. For example, if the enchantment that entered the battlefield is an Aura with "enchant land," it won't move.
2013/07/01: You may attach the Aura to the Cat token only if the Aura and the token are both on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves. If the Aura leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, it won't become attached to the token. If the token leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, the Aura won't move.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/10/01: Abilities that trigger when a player gains life may trigger as a result of this ability.
2007/10/01: In other multiplayer formats, each player's life total is set to the highest life total within their range of influence. These changes happen at the same time. For example, if each player has a range of influence of one, and the players in the game are Alice (4 life), Barry (8 life), Carrie (11 life), and Doug (7 life), in that order, then Alice's life total will become 8 and Barry and Doug's life totals will each become 11.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team chooses one person on that team to gain the appropriate amount of life. This basically means that the triggered ability will set the life total of each team to that of the team with the highest life total.</Rulings>

<Artist>Willian Murai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>405135</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/04/26: <Banishing Light>'s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like <Banishing Light> have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the permanent when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield.
2014/04/26: If <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target nonland permanent won't be exiled.
2014/04/26: Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
2014/04/26: If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
2014/04/26: The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after <Banishing Light> leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. <Banishing Light> and the returned card aren't on the battlefield at the same time.
2014/04/26: In a multiplayer game, if <Banishing Light>'s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: Bestow is an alternative cost to cast the spell with bestow. It can't be combined with other alternative costs, such as casting a spell "without paying its mana cost."
2018/07/13: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a bestow cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2018/07/13: A spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both. Similarly, a permanent with bestow is either a creature or an Aura, but not both.
2018/07/13: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow still resolves if its target is illegal. Instead of entering the battlefield as an Aura, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2018/07/13: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield or becomes an illegal creature for the Aura to enchant. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2018/07/13: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2018/07/13: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.

2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/02/01: The triggered ability will resolve before the enchantment spell that caused it to trigger.
2009/02/01: When you cast an Aura spell, you have to choose a target for it before this ability puts an Angel token onto the battlefield. In other words, you can't play an Aura spell intending to enchant the Angel that will be created as a result.
2009/02/01: Casting <Sigil of the Empty Throne> won't trigger its own ability. It has to be on the battlefield for its ability to work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/02/01: If you return an enchantment creature card with bestow to the battlefield, you can't pay its bestow cost. It won't be an Aura and can't be attached to a creature.
2014/02/01: If the enchantment card is an Aura, you choose a legal player or object for that Aura to enchant as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target the player or object, so it's possible to enchant an opposing creature with hexproof this way, for example. If there's no player or object the Aura can legally enchant, it stays in the graveyard.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/08/15: A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
2010/08/15: The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2010/08/15: If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.
2010/08/15: If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.

<Rulings>2013/09/15: <Nighthowler>'s last ability functions only from the battlefield. In other zones, <Nighthowler> is a 0/0 enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

2010/03/01: Each target you choose must be different.
2010/03/01: For example, if you want <Comet Storm> to deal 4 damage to each of three different targets, that means X is 4 and you're kicking the spell twice. You'll pay a mana cost of {4}{R}{R}, plus a kicker cost of {1}, plus another kicker cost of {1}, for a total of {6}{R}{R}.

However, if the Incarnation lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer, for example), the ability wouldn't trigger and the Incarnation would remain in the graveyard.

<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>405219</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/01/24: If removing two +1/+1 counters from <Experiment One> causes the amount of damage already marked on <Experiment One> to be equal to or greater than its toughness, it will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action before the regeneration shield is created.
2013/04/15: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare the stats.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare power to power and toughness to toughness.
2013/04/15: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won't trigger at all.
2013/04/15: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve.
2013/04/15: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
2013/04/15: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with evolve, so that ability does nothing.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: If you cast this as a spell, you choose how many and which creatures to devour as part of the resolution of that spell. (It can't be countered at this point.) The same is true of a spell or ability that lets you put a creature with devour onto the battlefield.
2008/10/01: You may sacrifice only creatures that are already on the battlefield. If a creature with devour and another creature are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, the creature with devour can't devour that other creature. The creature with devour also can't devour itself.
2008/10/01: If multiple creatures with devour are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you may use each one's devour ability. A creature you already control can be devoured by only one of them, however. (In other words, you can't sacrifice the same creature to satisfy multiple devour abilities.) All creatures devoured this way are sacrificed at the same time.

<Rulings>2013/09/15: You don't choose whether the spell is going to be an Aura spell or not until the spell is already on the stack. Abilities that affect when you can cast a spell, such as flash, will apply to the spell after you've made this choice. For example, an effect that said you can cast creature spells as though they have flash won't allow you to cast a creature card with bestow as an Aura spell anytime you could cast an instant, but one that said you can cast Aura spells as though they have flash will.
2013/09/15: On the stack, a spell with bestow is either a creature spell or an Aura spell. It's never both, although it's an enchantment spell in either case.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
2013/09/15: Unlike other Auras, an Aura with bestow isn't put into its owner's graveyard if it becomes unattached. Rather, the effect making it an Aura ends, it loses enchant creature, and it remains on the battlefield as an enchantment creature. It can attack (and its {T} abilities can be activated, if it has any) on the turn it becomes unattached if it's been under your control continuously, even as an Aura, since your most recent turn began.
2013/09/15: If a permanent with bestow enters the battlefield by any method other than being cast, it will be an enchantment creature. You can't choose to pay the bestow cost and have it become an Aura.
2013/09/15: Auras attached to a creature don't become tapped when the creature becomes tapped. Except in some rare cases, an Aura with bestow remains untapped when it becomes unattached and becomes a creature.
2013/09/15: An Aura that becomes a creature is no longer put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. Rather, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield as long as it's a creature. While it's a creature, it can't be attached to another permanent or player. An Aura that's not attached to a legal permanent or player as defined by its enchant ability and also isn't a creature will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/04/15: If you don't pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
2013/04/15: Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
2013/04/15: Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell's color will still prevent that damage.
2013/04/15: Overload doesn't change when you can cast the spell.
2013/04/15: Casting a spell with overload doesn't change that spell's mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
2013/04/15: Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.

For example, if you attack with a 5/5 creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player.

<CardText>Play with the top card of your library revealed.
You may cast the top card of your library if it's an instant or sorcery card.
Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your library, copy it. You may choose new targets for the copy.</CardText>
<Artist>Jason Chan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>405296</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/04/15: Melek doesn't affect the timing rules associated with when you can cast the card. If it's a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
2013/04/15: You still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs, such as overload costs. Although you can't pay additional costs for the copy that's created, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
2013/04/15: Melek's last ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell you cast from your library, not just one with targets.
2013/04/15: When the last ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2013/04/15: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2013/04/15: If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Debt to the Deathless has), the copy has the same value of X.
2013/04/15: Instant and sorcery cards with miracle allow a player to cast a card immediately upon drawing it. If you cast a spell this way, you're casting it from your hand, not your library. Melek's ability won't trigger.
2013/04/15: The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't suspend it, cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.
2013/04/15: If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, the new top card won't be revealed until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability.
2013/04/15: When playing with the top card of your library revealed, if an effect tells you to draw several cards, reveal each one before you draw it.</Rulings>

2013/04/15: The amount of life you gain from extort is based on the total amount of life lost, not necessarily the number of opponents you have. For example, if your opponent's life total can't change (perhaps because that player controls Platinum Emperion), you won't gain any life.
2013/04/15: The extort ability doesn't target any player.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/04/26: A constellation ability triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. Enchantments with other card types, such as enchantment creatures, will also cause constellation abilities to trigger.
2014/04/26: An Aura spell without bestow that has an illegal target when it tries to resolve won't resolve and put into its owner's graveyard. It won't enter the battlefield and constellation abilities won't trigger. An Aura spell with bestow won't be countered this way. It will revert to being an enchantment creature and resolve, entering the battlefield and triggering constellation abilities.
2014/04/26: When an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, each constellation ability of permanents you control will trigger. You can put these abilities on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.</Rulings>

<Artist>Randy Gallegos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>405164</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/08/01: Casting a card by using its retrace ability works just like casting any other spell, with two exceptions: You're casting it from your graveyard rather than your hand, and you must discard a land card in addition to any other costs.
2008/08/01: A retrace card cast from your graveyard follows the normal timing rules for its card type.
2008/08/01: When a retrace card you cast from your graveyard resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered, it's put back into your graveyard. You may use the retrace ability to cast it again.
2008/08/01: If the active player casts a spell that has retrace, that player may cast that card again after it resolves, before another player can remove the card from the graveyard. The active player has priority after the spell resolves, so they can immediately cast a new spell. Since casting a card with retrace from the graveyard moves that card onto the stack, no one else would have the chance to affect it while it's still in the graveyard.</Rulings>

2008/08/01: If the affected creature gains an ability after <Snakeform> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2008/08/01: If <Snakeform> affects a creature with changeling, the creature will lose its changeling ability, and will no longer be all creature types.
2009/10/01: The power/toughness-setting effect overwrites other effects that set power and toughness only if those effects existed before this spell resolved. It will not overwrite effects that modify power or toughness (whether from a static ability, counters, or a resolved spell or ability), nor will it overwrite effects that set power and toughness which come into existence after this spell resolves. Effects that switch the creature's power and toughness are always applied after any other power or toughness changing effects, including this one, regardless of the order in which they are created.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.

2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Fellwar Stone> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Artist>Franz Vohwinkel</Artist>
<Multiverseid>405373</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as Rampant Growth) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with Yavimaya Dryad's ability, for example).
2010/03/01: When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.
2010/03/01: You choose whether to pay {2} as the ability resolves. You may pay {2} only once per resolution.</Rulings>
