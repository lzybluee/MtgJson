<CardText>Split second (As long as this spell is on the stack, players can't cast spells or activate abilities that aren't mana abilities.)
You can't lose the game this turn and your opponents can't win the game this turn. Until end of turn, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Zug</Artist>
<Multiverseid>110504</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/09/25: The last sentence applies only if your life total is being reduced by damage. Other effects or costs (such as "lose 1 life" or "pay 1 life") can reduce your life total below 1 as normal.
2006/09/25: You can't pay more life than you have.
2006/09/25: If your life total goes below 1, being dealt damage will not increase it back up to 1.
2006/09/25: After the effect wears off during the cleanup step, you'll lose the game if your total is 0 or less (or you have ten or more poison counters).
2006/09/25: <Angel's Grace> doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain life, even if that damage would reduce your life total to less than 1.
2013/06/07: Players still get priority while a card with split second is on the stack.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from activating mana abilities.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent triggered abilities from triggering. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from performing special actions. Notably, players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
2013/06/07: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2013/06/07: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.

2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.

You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>113505</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

2006/09/25: The controller of a face-down creature can look at it at any time, even if it doesn't have morph. Other players can't, but the rules for face-down permanents state that "you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other." As a result, all players must be able to figure out what each of the creatures <Ixidron> turned face down is.
2006/09/25: You turn the creatures face-down *as* <Ixidron> enters the battlefield. There is never a moment when <Ixidron> is on the battlefield and the creatures are face-up. If a creature on the battlefield has a "whenever another creature enters the battlefield" ability, it won't trigger because that creature will be face down before <Ixidron> enters the battlefield.
2006/09/25: Turning a face-down creature face-down typically has no effect; the creature's status is unchanged.
2018/04/27: Creatures turned face down by <Ixidron> are 2/2 creatures with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion symbol, and no mana cost. These values are copiable if an object becomes a copy of one of those creatures, and their normal values are not copiable.</Rulings>

Suspend 3—{1}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{U} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Carl Critchlow</Artist>
<Multiverseid>109715</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>John Zeleznik</Artist>
<Multiverseid>110499</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2006/09/25: If <Trickbind> counters an activated ability of a permanent, no activated abilities of that permanent can be activated for the remainder of the turn. This includes activated abilities other than the one that was countered, as well as any mana abilities that permanent may have. Other abilities of that permanent, including triggered abilities and static abilities, are unaffected.
2006/09/25: <Trickbind> can be used to counter the storm triggered ability. Doing so prevents the copies from being created, but doesn't counter the original storm spell.
2006/09/25: <Trickbind> can be used to counter the madness triggered ability. The affected card will remain exiled.
2006/09/25: <Trickbind> can be used to counter the suspend "remove a counter" ability. If so, the counter won't get removed, but the ability will trigger again as normal later on. <Trickbind> can also be used to counter the suspend "play this card" ability. If so, the card stays exiled (the ability won't trigger again). Using suspend to exile a card in your hand is neither an activated nor a triggered ability, so it can't be countered this way.
2006/09/25: <Trickbind> can be used to counter the echo triggered ability. If so, the echo ability won't trigger again so the echo cost is never paid.
2006/09/25: <Trickbind> can be used to counter the flanking triggered ability.
2006/09/25: <Trickbind> can't counter or prevent paying the morph cost to turn a face-down creature face up, since that action doesn't use the stack.
2013/06/07: Players still get priority while a card with split second is on the stack.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from activating mana abilities.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent triggered abilities from triggering. If one does, its controller puts it on the stack and chooses targets for it, if any. Those abilities will resolve as normal.
2013/06/07: Split second doesn't prevent players from performing special actions. Notably, players may turn face-down creatures face up while a spell with split second is on the stack.
2013/06/07: Casting a spell with split second won't affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
2013/06/07: If the resolution of a triggered ability involves casting a spell, that spell can't be cast if a spell with split second is on the stack.
2016/06/08: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.</Rulings>

<Artist>Quinton Hoover</Artist>
<Multiverseid>109765</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: <Vesuvan Shapeshifter>'s ability to become a copy is a replacement effect. Because turning a creature face up and applying replacement effects both don't use the stack, players won't be able to take actions between the time you announce that you're turning <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> face up and the time it has become a copy of the creature of your choice.
2018/03/16: <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2018/03/16: If the chosen creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/03/16: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another <Vesuvan Shapeshifter>), then <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies whatever the chosen creature copied.
2018/03/16: If the chosen creature is a token, <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is not a token in this case.
2018/03/16: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work as it enters the battlefield. Similarly, any "[when/as] [this creature] is turned face up" abilities of the chosen creature will work if <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is turned face up.
2018/03/16: If <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2018/03/16: When <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is turned face down, its copy effect wears off. While it's face down, it's a 2/2 face-down <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> that can be turned face up for a morph cost of {1}{U}.
2018/03/16: If another creature copies <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> while it's face up and copying another creature, the new creature will become a copy of whatever <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> is copying and gain the "you may turn this creature face down" ability. It won't gain morph {1}{U}. If that creature is then turned face down, its copy effect will continue and it'll be a face-down version of whatever it's copying. If the creature it's copying has morph, it can be turned face up. If the creature it's copying doesn't have morph, it's stuck face down.
2018/03/16: If <Vesuvan Shapeshifter> copies a face-down creature, it becomes a face-up 2/2 colorless, nameless creature with no abilities other than the one it gives itself.</Rulings>

Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/09/25: When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if player A has 5 life and player B has 3 life before the exchange, player A will lose 2 life and player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
2011/01/01: If an effect says that a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player who has a lower life total; in that case, the exchange won't happen.</Rulings>

Sacrifice an artifact, creature, or land: Remove a time counter from Greater Gargadon. Activate this ability only if Greater Gargadon is suspended.</CardText>
<Artist>Rob Alexander</Artist>
<Multiverseid>111048</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>113528</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: Although originally printed with a characteristic-defining ability that defined its color, this card now has a color indicator. This color indicator can't be affected by text-changing effects (such as the one created by Crystal Spray), although color-changing effects can still overwrite it.
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.

2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/09/25: The creatures get trample once; they don't get trample for each basic land type.
2006/09/25: The effect counts basic land *types*, not the number of basic lands. Therefore the maximum bonus is +5/+5.
2006/09/25: The affected creatures and the power/toughness bonus are fixed when <Tromp the Domains> resolves.
2009/02/01: To determine the number of basic land types among lands you control, look at the lands you have on the battlefield and ask yourself whether the subtypes Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest appear within that group. The number of times you say yes (topping out at five) tells you how powerful your domain abilities will be.
2009/02/01: How many lands you control of a particular basic land type is irrelevant to a domain ability, as long as that number is greater than zero. As far as domain is concerned, ten Forests is the same as one Forest.
2009/02/01: A number of nonbasic lands have basic land types. Domain abilities don't count the number of lands you control — they count the number of basic land types among lands you control, even if that means checking the same land twice. For example, if you control a Tundra, an Overgrown Tomb, and a Madblind Mountain, you'll have a Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest among the lands you control. Your domain abilities will be maxed out.</Rulings>

Suspend 4—{W}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {W}{U} and exile it with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)</CardText>
<Artist>Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai</Artist>
<Multiverseid>114903</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/07/01: In a Commander game where this card is your commander, you cannot suspend it from the Command zone.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2006/09/25: <Locket of Yesterdays> reduces only the amount of mana you need to pay to cast a spell. The spell's mana cost and converted mana cost are not affected.
2006/09/25: Colored costs can't be reduced by this effect. For example, a spell that costs {2}{R} can't be reduced by more than {2}.
2006/09/25: The spell being cast doesn't reduce its own cost, even if you're casting it from a graveyard. At the time the cost is reduced, the spell is on the stack.</Rulings>

<CardText>Suspend 3—{0} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, pay {0} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
{T}, Sacrifice Lotus Bloom: Add three mana of any one color.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Zug</Artist>
<Multiverseid>114904</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2016/09/20: This has no mana cost, which means its mana cost can't be paid for effects such as replicate from Djinn Illuminatus or flashback from Snapcaster Mage.</Rulings>
