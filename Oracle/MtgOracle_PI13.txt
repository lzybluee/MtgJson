<CardText>Corrupt deals damage to any target equal to the number of Swamps you control. You gain life equal to the damage dealt this way.</CardText>
<Artist>Alex Horley-Orlandelli</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The swamps are counted on resolution.
2010/08/15: The life you gain is equal to the damage dealt by <Corrupt>, not necessarily to the number of Swamps you control (if some or all of the damage is prevented, for example).
2010/08/15: The amount of damage dealt to a creature is not bounded by its toughness, and the amount of damage dealt to a player is not bounded by that player's life total. For example, if <Corrupt> deals 6 damage to a 2/2 creature, you'll gain 6 life.
2013/07/01: <Corrupt> counts any land you control with the subtype Swamp, not just ones named Swamp.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>U (1)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds an additional {U}.</CardText>
<Flavor>"There's nothing like the high seas to clear your head or escape pursuers."</Flavor>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/03/01: The delayed triggered ability triggers and produces {U} any time a land with the land-type Island is tapped for mana, even if that land has other types or the mana for which it was tapped is another color. For example, if you tap a Breeding Pool for {G}, <High Tide> will give you an extra {U}.
2010/03/01: The effect applies even if the Island in question entered the battlefield after <High Tide> resolved.</Rulings>
