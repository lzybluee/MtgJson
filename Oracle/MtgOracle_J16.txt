<Rulings>2017/11/17: <Mana Drain> can target a spell that can't be countered. When <Mana Drain> resolves, that spell won't be countered, but you'll still add mana at the beginning of your next main phase.
2017/11/17: If the target spell is an illegal target when <Mana Drain> tries to resolve, it won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any mana.
2017/11/17: <Mana Drain>'s delayed triggered ability will usually trigger at the beginning of your precombat main phase. However, if you cast <Mana Drain> during your precombat main phase or during your combat phase, its delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of that turn's postcombat main phase.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: If you cast a commander from your hand, the additional cost based on the number of times you've cast it from your command zone (sometimes referred to as the "commander tax") doesn't apply. Additionally, that casting won't add to the tax if you later cast the commander from the command zone.
2015/11/04: If your commander isn't in the command zone (or you're not playing Commander) as the last ability resolves, nothing happens.
2016/11/08: If you have two commanders with the partner ability in the command zone, <Command Beacon>'s effect puts one of your choice into your hand, not both.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/11/04: You choose the modes as you cast the spell. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/11/04: If a mode requires a target, you can select that mode only if there's a legal target available. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes you don't choose. Each time you select that mode, you can choose a different target, or you can choose the same target.
2015/11/04: No matter which combination of modes you choose, you always follow the instructions of a Confluence in the order they are written. If the same mode is chosen more than once, you choose their relative order as you cast the spell.
2015/11/04: No player can cast spells or activate abilities in between the modes of a resolving spell.
2015/11/04: If a Confluence is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/11/04: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Confluence resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>
