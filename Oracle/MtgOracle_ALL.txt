<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Spiny Starfish>'s first ability creates a regeneration shield for it. <Spiny Starfish>'s second ability checks whether it _used_ any regeneration shields that turn, not whether any regeneration shields were created for it.
2009/10/01: The second ability doesn't care where the regeneration shields <Spiny Starfish> used that turn came from. If it regenerated due to a regeneration shield from Refresh, for example, the ability will still put a Starfish token onto the battlefield.
2009/10/01: The second ability has an "intervening 'if' clause," so it won't trigger at all unless <Spiny Starfish> had regenerated that turn. However, the number of tokens that are created isn't determined until the ability resolves (in case it regenerates again before that time).
2009/10/01: If <Spiny Starfish> regenerates during the end step after its second ability has resolved, no tokens will be created as a result.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: <Benthic Explorers> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of the land untapped to pay its cost, but it doesn't check the costs of those abilities. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you untap a tapped Vivid Crag an opponent controls while paying for <Benthic Explorers>'s ability, you can add one mana of any color to your mana pool. It doesn't matter whether that Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it.
2009/10/01: When determining what types of mana an opponent's land could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to that land's mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Benthic Explorers> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders an opponent's land (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) puts on the mana it produces. It just cares about types of mana.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: Untapping a tapped land an opponent controls is part of the cost of <Benthic Explorers>'s ability. If no opponent controls a tapped land, the ability can't be activated.
2009/10/01: The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
2009/10/01: <Benthic Explorers> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of the land untapped to pay its cost, but it doesn't check the costs of those abilities. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If you untap a tapped Vivid Crag an opponent controls while paying for <Benthic Explorers>'s ability, you can add one mana of any color to your mana pool. It doesn't matter whether that Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it.
2009/10/01: When determining what types of mana an opponent's land could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to that land's mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Benthic Explorers> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders an opponent's land (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) puts on the mana it produces. It just cares about types of mana.</Rulings>
