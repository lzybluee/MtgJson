Whenever Intet, the Dreamer deals combat damage to a player, you may pay {2}{U}. If you do, exile the top card of your library face down. You may look at that card for as long as it remains exiled. You may play that card without paying its mana cost for as long as Intet remains on the battlefield.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Scott</Artist>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: After Intet leaves the battlefield, if a card exiled this way is still exiled, you may still look at it. You won't be able to play it, though.
2007/02/01: Once you play a card this way, it leaves the Exile zone and goes to the stack. You won't be able to play it again.</Rulings>

Whenever you cast a creature spell, put a +1/+1 counter on Animar, Soul of Elements.
Creature spells you cast cost {1} less to cast for each +1/+1 counter on Animar.</CardText>
<Artist>Peter Mohrbacher</Artist>
<Rulings>2018/03/16: Animar's triggered ability triggers only when a creature spell is cast, after costs are paid. The counter put on Animar for a creature spell won't affect the cost of that creature spell, only future ones.
2018/03/16: Animar's triggered ability resolves before the creature spell that causes it to trigger. The ability will resolve even if that spell is countered.
2018/03/16: To determine the total cost of a creature spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the creature remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.</Rulings>

<Artist>Steve Argyle</Artist>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: The number of cards in your hand is checked at the beginning of your upkeep before you have the opportunity to cast spells and activate abilities. If you have seven or more cards in your hand at that time, Damia's last ability won't trigger.
2011/09/22: After the ability has triggered but before it resolves, you have the opportunity to cast spells and activate abilities.
2011/09/22: When Damia's triggered ability tries to resolve, if you have seven or more cards in your hand, it will have no effect. If you have fewer than seven cards in your hand, you'll determine the difference and draw that many cards.
2011/09/22: Effects can modify the number of cards you'll draw. For example, if you have four cards in your hand and control Thought Reflection ("If you would draw a card, draw two cards instead."), you'll draw six cards.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: If Karador is your commander, calculate any cost increases, including the one based on the number of times you've cast Karador from the command zone, before considering Karador's cost-reduction ability.
2011/09/22: If you somehow cast Karador from a graveyard, its cost-reduction ability won't count itself.
2011/09/22: Although Karador's second ability allows you to cast one creature card from your graveyard on each of your turns, it doesn't change when you can cast that card. Unless it has flash, the creature card must be cast during one of your main phases when the stack is empty.
2011/09/22: Karador's second ability doesn't affect the costs you need to pay to cast that creature spell.
2011/09/22: Karador's first ability functions on the stack. Karador's second ability functions only on the battlefield.
2011/09/22: If you cast a creature card from your graveyard, then Karador leaves the battlefield, then returns to the battlefield, you may cast another creature card from your graveyard that turn. If you didn't cast a creature card from your graveyard while Karador was on the battlefield the first time, you may still cast only one creature card from your graveyard when it returns to the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2011/09/22: You can't choose to exile just one creature card.
2011/09/22: The two creature cards may come from the same graveyard or different graveyards.

<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Rulings>2011/09/22: Each time the first ability triggers, you can pay {U}{R} only one time to get one copy of the spell. Each time the second ability triggers, you can pay {G}{U} only one time to get one token.
2011/09/22: If the spell that caused Riku's first ability to trigger has left the stack by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {U}{R}. If you do, you'll copy the spell as it last existed on the stack.
2011/09/22: Riku's first ability triggers whenever you cast any instant or sorcery spell, regardless of whether that spell has targets.
2011/09/22: If the copied spell has {X} in its mana cost, the value of X is copied.
2011/09/22: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy has the same mode as the original spell. You can't choose a different one.
2011/09/22: You can't pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy. Notably, if the original spell was kicked (or kicked a certain number of times), the copy will also be kicked (or kicked that many times).
2011/09/22: If the creature that caused Riku's second ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {G}{U}. If you do, you'll still put a token onto the battlefield. That token has the copiable values of the characteristics of that creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2011/09/22: As the token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it.
2011/09/22: The copiable values of the token's characteristics are the same as the copiable values of the characteristics of the creature it's copying.
2011/09/22: If the creature had {X} in its mana cost, X must be 0. Note this is different from an {X} found in the mana cost of a copied spell.</Rulings>
