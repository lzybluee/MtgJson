2008/10/01: When you cycle this card, first the cycling ability goes on the stack, then the triggered ability goes on the stack on top of it. The triggered ability will resolve before you draw a card from the cycling ability.
2008/10/01: The cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. If the triggered ability doesn't resolve (due to being countered with Stifle, for example, or if all its targets have become illegal), the cycling ability will still resolve and you'll draw a card.</Rulings>

2007/10/01: If a previous effect switched the creature's power and toughness, that effect still applies (though it will apply to the creature's new power and toughness).
2007/10/01: <Lignify> will overwrite static abilities that come from the creature itself (such as the one on Verduran Enchantress) because <Lignify> causes the creature to lose that ability before it gets a chance to apply.
2009/10/01: <Lignify> will overwrite any previous effects that set the enchanted creature's power or toughness (such as Serendib Sorcerer does). Any such effects that apply after <Lignify> entered the battlefield will work normally.
2009/10/01: <Lignify> will not overwrite effects such as those from Glorious Anthem, counters, or Giant Growth that change the enchanted creature's power or toughness without setting it to a specific value. Apply such effects after applying <Lignify>.</Rulings>
