<Rulings>2019/05/03: The ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Ajani's Welcome or 2 life from Battlefield Promotion.
2019/05/03: If <Ajani's Pridemate> is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
2019/05/03: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Ajani's Pridemate>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/05/03: If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Ajani's Pridemate> triggers only once.
2019/05/03: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.</Rulings>

2018/07/13: If a replacement effect allows a player to modify or replace an event by putting counters on a creature or player affected by <Suncleanser>, that player may apply that replacement effect, but they won't get counters. If the original event is entirely replaced (such as by applying Soul-Scar Mage's replacement effect), the original event won't happen.
2018/07/13: Damage from a source with wither has no effect on an affected creature. No -1/-1 counters are put on them, and no damage is marked on them. The damage is still dealt for purposes of effects that care about damage, such as lifelink.
2018/07/13: Damage from a source with infect has no effect on an affected creature or player. No -1/-1 counters are put on creatures, and no damage is marked on them. Players don't get poison counters and they don't lose life. The damage is still dealt for purposes of effects that care about damage, such as lifelink.
2018/07/13: While resolving a cumulative upkeep trigger of an affected creature, you'll fail to put a counter on that permanent, then you may pay for the age counters already on it. If it has no age counters on it, you may pay {0}.</Rulings>

As Metamorphic Alteration enters the battlefield, choose a creature.
Enchanted creature is a copy of the chosen creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Livia Prima</Artist>
<Multiverseid>447196</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: You can choose only a creature on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Metamorphic Alteration> copies exactly what is printed on the chosen creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it as any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
2018/07/13: The characteristics that will be copied are determined as <Metamorphic Alteration>'s effect first begins to apply. If the copiable values of the chosen creature change later, or if that creature leaves the battlefield, the enchanted creature's characteristics are unaffected.
2018/07/13: If the chosen creature isn't normally a creature (for example, if the chosen creature is an animated Treetop Village), the enchanted creature becomes a copy of that noncreature permanent. This causes <Metamorphic Alteration> to be illegally attached, and it's put into its owner's graveyard. The previously enchanted creature returns to being itself.
2018/07/13: If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is enchanted by another <Metamorphic Alteration>), then the enchanted creature becomes a copy of whatever the chosen creature copied.
2018/07/13: If the chosen creature is a token, <Metamorphic Alteration> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. The enchanted creature doesn't become a token in this case.
2018/07/13: The enchanted creature will be a copy of the chosen creature as it dies, so any "when this creature dies" abilities it gains from the copy effect will trigger. Any "when this creature dies" abilities it normally has will not trigger.
2018/07/13: If <Metamorphic Alteration> somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, it can't have the enchanted creature become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: <Metamorphic Alteration> can cause a creature to become a copy of itself. This generally has no effect, but if that creature has a pair of linked abilities, the new abilities it has from the copy effect aren't linked to the abilities it had before.
2018/07/13: The copiable values granted by <Metamorphic Alteration> are locked in as the creature is chosen. The enchanted creature won't change if the chosen creature's copiable values change.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: <Skilled Animator> doesn't remove any abilities the target artifact has.
2018/07/13: The artifact retains any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has. Notably, if an Equipment becomes an artifact creature, it can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.
2018/07/13: If the artifact was already a creature, its base power and toughness will each become 5. This overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after <Skilled Animator>'s ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2018/07/13: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the ones created by Titanic Growth or a +/1+1 counter, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
2018/07/13: The resulting artifact creature will be able to attack on your turn if it's been under your control continuously since the turn began. That is, it doesn't matter how long it's been a creature, just how long it's been on the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2019/07/12: The ability of <Epicure of Blood> triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of <Epicure of Blood> triggers only once.
2019/07/12: Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, <Epicure of Blood>'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
2019/07/12: In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.

<Rulings>2018/07/13: The amounts that are lost are rounded up, not the amounts kept. For example, a player with 5 life, five cards in hand, and five creatures would lose 3 life, discard three cards, and sacrifice three creatures.
2018/07/13: Because the instructions are followed in order, abilities of the creatures a player will sacrifice may modify or trigger on losing life, discarding cards, and/or sacrificing creatures. Abilities that trigger this way will resolve after <Fraying Omnipotence> is done resolving.
2018/07/13: When <Fraying Omnipotence> resolves, first each player loses the appropriate amount of life at once. Next, the player whose turn it is chooses an appropriate number of cards in hand without revealing them, then each other player in turn order does the same, and then those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Then, the player whose turn it is chooses an appropriate number of creatures they control. Each other player in turn order does the same, knowing choices made by previous players. Finally, all of the chosen creatures are sacrificed simultaneously.
2018/07/13: In a Two-Headed Giant game, <Fraying Omnipotence> causes each player to lose half of their team's life, rounded up. This means that teams at an even life total will have 0 life, and teams at an odd life total will have -1 life. The game then ends in a draw.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jason Rainville</Artist>
<Multiverseid>447240</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Isareth's triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, you may pay {X}. When you do, a second ability triggers and you pick a target creature card to return. This is different from abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities after mana is paid and the target creature card is chosen, but before that card is returned.
2018/07/13: Because all attacking creatures are chosen at once, a creature returned this way can't attack during the same combat as it returns, even if it has haste.
2018/07/13: If a card in your graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
2018/07/13: If you somehow remove a corpse counter from a creature Isareth has returned to the battlefield, the replacement effect that will exile it continues to apply. The counter is only to help remind you which creatures will be exiled if they would leave the battlefield.
2018/07/13: If Isareth leaves the battlefield, the replacement effect continues to apply. If one of the creatures it returned would leave the battlefield, it'll be exiled instead.
2018/07/13: Because to die means to be put into a graveyard from the battlefield, a creature that is exiled instead doesn't "die." Abilities that would trigger when it dies won't trigger.</Rulings>

2018/07/13: If you control no artifacts as <Phylactery Lich> enters the battlefield, its first ability won't do anything. As soon as it enters the battlefield, its last ability will trigger (unless you control some other permanent with a phylactery counter on it) and you'll have to sacrifice it.

2018/07/13: <Phylactery Lich>'s last ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.

<Multiverseid>447291</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: If you cast a creature spell that will enter the battlefield with a number of +1/+1 counters, such as Hungering Hydra, those counters aren't considered when determining whether either ability of <Sarkhan's Unsealing> triggers. Similarly, effects that will raise the creature's power once it has entered the battlefield won't apply.
2018/07/13: Each of the triggered abilities of <Sarkhan's Unsealing> resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
2018/07/13: If a creature card's power is written as * and an ability defines its power, that ability applies while the creature spell is on the stack. Sarkhan's unsealing checks its power only as you finish paying costs; it doesn't matter what the spell's power is as you begin to cast it or when the triggered ability resolves.
2018/07/13: In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability of <Sarkhan's Unsealing> causes the opposing team to lose 8 life.</Rulings>

Similarly, effects that will raise the creature's power once it has entered the battlefield won't apply.
2018/07/13: If another creature has an ability that changes its power when it attacks, such as Brawl-Bash Ogre, you may have that ability resolve before Goreclaw's last ability.
2018/07/13: Goreclaw's last ability affects only creatures you control with the appropriate power at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get either bonus, and a creature you control whose power decreases later in the turn won't lose either bonus.</Rulings>

<CardText>Flying, vigilance
Whenever a creature with defender enters the battlefield under your control, draw a card.
Each creature you control with defender assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power and can attack as though it didn't have defender.</CardText>
<Artist>Even Amundsen</Artist>
<Multiverseid>447348</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Arcades's last ability doesn't actually change any creature's power. It changes only the amount of combat damage it assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values. For example, Rabid Bite won't cause a creature to deal damage equal to its toughness.
2018/07/13: If Arcades leaves the battlefield after a creature with defender has attacked, that creature remains an attacking creature, although it will assign damage equal to its power.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/07/13: Chromium stops being an Elder Dragon for the turn once its last ability has resolved. It's still a legendary creature named <Chromium, the Mutable>.

The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
2018/07/13: If Chromium gains an ability after its activated ability resolves, it will keep that ability.

<Rulings>2018/07/13: When Nicol Bolas's enters-the-battlefield triggered ability resolves, first the next opponent in turn order (or, if it's an opponent's turn, that opponent) chooses a card in their hand without revealing it, then each other opponent in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen cards are discarded at the same time.
2018/07/13: If Nicol Bolas leaves the battlefield after his creature face's activated ability has been activated but before it resolves, the card remains in whichever zone it moves to. It won't be exiled or return transformed.
2018/07/13: Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
2018/07/13: While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. For example, Nicol Bolas has the characteristics of its creature face in the graveyard, even if it was a planeswalker on the battlefield before it was put into the graveyard.
2018/07/13: A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up. The back face of a double-faced card can't be played.
2018/07/13: If another permanent that isn't a double-faced card (such as Mirror Image) becomes a copy of <Nicol Bolas, the Ravager>, activating the ability to exile it and return it transformed will only exile it. It won't return to the battlefield at all.
2018/07/13: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any permanents you control from Nicol Bolas's third loyalty ability that came from other players' graveyards are exiled.
2018/07/13: The converted mana cost of a double-faced card is the converted mana cost of its front face, even while it's on the battlefield with its back face up. For example, the converted mana cost of Nicol Bolas, the Arisen is 4.
2018/07/13: Nicol Bolas, the Arisen has a color indicator on its typeline. This color indicator means that it's a blue, black, and red permanent.

<CardText>+1: Draw a card.
0: Until your next turn, target artifact you control becomes a 5/5 creature in addition to its other types.
-7: Put any number of cards from your hand onto the battlefield face down. They're 5/5 artifact creatures.</CardText>
<Artist>Zack Stella</Artist>
<Multiverseid>450233</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/07/13: Tezzeret's second ability doesn't remove any abilities the target artifact has.
2018/07/13: The artifact stops being a creature immediately before your turn begins. It will be a noncreature artifact during your untap step.
2018/07/13: The artifact retains any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has. Notably, if an Equipment becomes an artifact creature, it can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.
2018/07/13: If the artifact was already a creature, its base power and toughness will each become 5. This overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Tezzeret's ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
2018/07/13: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the ones created by Titanic Growth or a +/1+1 counter, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
2018/07/13: The resulting artifact creature will be able to attack on your turn if it's been under your control continuously since the turn began. That is, it doesn't matter how long it's been a creature, just how long it's been on the battlefield.
2018/07/13: Cards put onto the battlefield using Tezzeret's third ability enter the battlefield as 5/5 artifact creatures. They don't enter the battlefield with their own characteristics and then become 5/5.
2018/07/13: If a double-faced card (such as Nicol Bolas, the Ravager) is put onto the battlefield face down, you don't reveal it as you do so. The characteristics of its back face don't apply.
2018/07/13: You may look at face-down permanents you control at any time.
2018/07/13: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it to all players.
2018/07/13: If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down creature or if a token is created that's a copy of one, that copy has the same characteristics as the face-down creature (in this case, a 5/5 artifact creature with no other characteristics), even though the copy is face up.
2018/07/13: The Core Set 2019 set includes no way to turn these cards face up. If an effect from cards outside of this set does turn one face up, the effect causing it to be a 5/5 artifact creature ends. If such an effect tries to turn an instant or sorcery card face up, reveal that card and it stays face down. In that case, it remains a 5/5 artifact creature.
2018/07/13: If an effect tries to return a face-down creature to the battlefield after it leaves (such as Oath of Teferi from the Dominaria set or Abnormal Endurance from this set), that effect returns the card face up. If it tries to put an instant or sorcery card onto the battlefield this way, that card remains in its current zone instead.</Rulings>

No player may take actions between the time you choose two creature cards to return and the time they're returned. The destroyed cards can be among those returned to the battlefield.
2018/07/13: If any abilities trigger on the target creatures being destroyed, those abilities won't be put onto the stack until after you've put creature cards onto the battlefield from graveyards.
2018/07/13: You may activate Liliana's last ability without choosing any target creatures. You'll just put up to two creature cards onto the battlefield from graveyards. However, if you choose any targets and all of those targets become illegal before the ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve and you won't put any cards onto the battlefield.
2018/07/13: In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any permanents you control from Liliana's third ability that came from other players' graveyards are exiled.</Rulings>
