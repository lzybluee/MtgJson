<Rulings>2017/09/29: Unlike the other double-faced cards in the Ixalan set, Conqueror's Galleon is exiled and then returned to battlefield transformed. It will be considered a new object entering the battlefield. Notably, it will return to the battlefield untapped.
2017/09/29: Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
2017/09/29: If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
2017/09/29: Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
2017/09/29: Once a player announces that they are activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
2017/09/29: Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
2017/09/29: Conqueror's Galleon won't be exiled if it doesn't survive combat.
2017/09/29: Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
2017/09/29: Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
2017/09/29: You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
2017/09/29: For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
2017/09/29: When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
2017/09/29: If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.
2017/09/29: You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of a spell can't reduce that spell's colored mana requirements.

2017/09/29: If a fourth charge counter is put on Primal Amulet by something other than the resolution of its ability (as modified by any applicable replacement effects), you won't be able to remove those counters and transform it yet. You'll have to wait until you cast an instant or sorcery spell again.
2017/09/29: The mana produced by <Primal Wellspring> can be spent on anything, not just an instant or sorcery spell.
2017/09/29: Any instant or sorcery spell you spend the mana on will be copied, not just one that requires targets.
2017/09/29: The delayed triggered ability from <Primal Wellspring>'s mana ability will trigger even if <Primal Wellspring> leaves the battlefield before that mana is spent.
2017/09/29: If more than one mana produced by a <Primal Wellspring> is spent to cast a single instant or sorcery spell, the delayed triggered ability associated with each mana spent will trigger. That many copies will be created. It doesn't matter if this mana was produced by one <Primal Wellspring> or by multiple <Primal Wellspring>s.
2017/09/29: <Primal Wellspring>'s delayed triggered ability can copy the spell even if that spell is countered before the ability resolves.
2017/09/29: If a copy is created, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2017/09/29: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/09/29: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2017/09/29: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2017/09/29: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2017/09/29: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.

<Rulings>2017/09/29: Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of a spell can't reduce that spell's colored mana requirements.
2017/09/29: <Primal Amulet>'s last ability triggers once you've completed casting a spell. Notably, you can't use Primal Wellspring to pay for the spell that gives <Primal Amulet> its fourth counter.
2017/09/29: If a fourth charge counter is put on <Primal Amulet> by something other than the resolution of its ability (as modified by any applicable replacement effects), you won't be able to remove those counters and transform it yet. You'll have to wait until you cast an instant or sorcery spell again.
2017/09/29: The mana produced by Primal Wellspring can be spent on anything, not just an instant or sorcery spell.
2017/09/29: Any instant or sorcery spell you spend the mana on will be copied, not just one that requires targets.
2017/09/29: The delayed triggered ability from Primal Wellspring's mana ability will trigger even if Primal Wellspring leaves the battlefield before that mana is spent.
2017/09/29: If more than one mana produced by a Primal Wellspring is spent to cast a single instant or sorcery spell, the delayed triggered ability associated with each mana spent will trigger. That many copies will be created. It doesn't matter if this mana was produced by one Primal Wellspring or by multiple Primal Wellsprings.
2017/09/29: Primal Wellspring's delayed triggered ability can copy the spell even if that spell is countered before the ability resolves.
2017/09/29: If a copy is created, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2017/09/29: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2017/09/29: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2017/09/29: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
2017/09/29: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2017/09/29: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
