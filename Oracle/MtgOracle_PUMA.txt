<Rulings>2010/06/15: Annihilator abilities trigger and resolve during the declare attackers step. The defending player chooses and sacrifices the required number of permanents before they declare blockers. Any creatures sacrificed this way won't be able to block.
2010/06/15: If a creature with annihilator is attacking a planeswalker, and the defending player chooses to sacrifice that planeswalker, the attacking creature continues to attack. It may be blocked. If it isn't blocked, it simply won't deal combat damage to anything.
2018/12/07: Emrakul's second ability triggers as you cast it, and that ability resolves before the spell itself. It resolves even if that spell is somehow removed from the stack.
2018/12/07: Emrakul can be targeted by spells that try to counter it (such as Countersquall). Those spells will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter Emrakul won't do anything. Any other effects those spells have will work as normal.
2018/12/07: "Colored spells" is not synonymous with "colored cards." For example, even though creatures are spells when they're cast, they're not spells when they're on the battlefield and can block Emrakul; and triggered abilities of permanents entering the battlefield (such as that of Banishing Light) can target it.
2018/12/07: Emrakul can't be the target of colored Aura spells, but colored Auras can be put onto the battlefield enchanting it.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>457106</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: A game that restarts immediately ends the preceding game. The players in that game then immediately begin a new game. No player wins, loses, or draws the original game as a result of Karn's ability.
2018/12/07: Players can't move cards between their deck and sideboard before the new game.
2018/12/07: The player who controlled the ability that restarted the game is the starting player in the new game. The new game starts like a game normally does: Each player shuffles their deck (except the cards left in exile by Karn's ability). Each player's life total becomes 20 (or the starting life total for whatever format you're playing). Players draw a hand of seven cards. Players may take mulligans. Players may take actions based on cards in their opening hands, such as those of Leylines.
2018/12/07: Karn's first and third abilities are linked. Similarly, Karn's second and third abilities are linked. Only non-Aura permanent cards exiled by either of Karn's first two abilities will remain in exile when the game restarts.
2018/12/07: After the pregame procedure is complete but before the new game's first turn, Karn's ability finishes resolving and the cards left in exile are put onto the battlefield. If this causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put onto the stack at the beginning of the first upkeep step.
2018/12/07: Permanents put onto the battlefield due to Karn's ability will have been under the starting controller's control continuously since the beginning of that player's first turn. Creatures among them can attack and their activated abilities with {T} in the cost can be activated.
2018/12/07: Any permanents put onto the battlefield with Karn's ability that entered the battlefield tapped will untap during their controller's first untap step.
2018/12/07: No actions taken in the game that was restarted apply to the new game. For example, if you were dealt damage by Stigma Lasher in the original game, the effect that states you can't gain life doesn't carry over to the new game.
2018/12/07: Players won't have any counters or emblems they had in the original game.
2018/12/07: In a multiplayer game, any player who left the game before it was restarted with Karn's ability won't be involved in the new game.
2018/12/07: If a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the permanents you control from Karn's ability are exiled.
2018/12/07: In a Commander game, each player puts their commander into the command zone before shuffling their deck, unless it was exiled with Karn. In that case, the commander remains in exile and will be put onto the battlefield when Karn's ability finishes resolving.
2018/12/07: The number of times a player has cast their commander from the command zone resets to zero. The amount of combat damage dealt to players by each commander is reset to 0.</Rulings>

2013/07/01: Lethal damage and effects that say "destroy" won't cause a creature with indestructible to be put into the graveyard. However, a creature with indestructible can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons are if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary creature with the same name is controlled by the same player, or if its toughness is 0 or less.

2018/12/07: If you cast an instant or sorcery with {X} in its mana cost this way, you still choose the value of X as part of casting the spell and pay that cost.
2018/12/07: If an instant or sorcery card in your graveyard already has flashback, you may use either flashback ability to cast it from your graveyard.
2018/12/07: You may pay any optional additional costs the spell has, such as kicker costs. You must pay any mandatory additional costs the spell has, such as that of Tormenting Voice.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>457124</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: If you cast your second creature spell in a turn and <Vengevine> is in your graveyard, <Vengevine>'s second ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of that spell. The ability will resolve, allowing you to return <Vengevine> to the battlefield before the creature spell resolves. The ability resolves even if that creature spell is countered.
2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability works only if <Vengevine> is already in your graveyard as you finish casting your second creature spell in a turn and if it remains there until the ability resolves.
2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s triggered ability checks the spells you cast over the course of the entire turn, not just the ones you cast while <Vengevine> is in your graveyard. For example, if you cast a creature spell, then <Vengevine> is put into your graveyard, then you cast another creature spell, <Vengevine>'s ability triggers.
2018/12/07: <Vengevine>'s ability triggers only for the second creature spell you cast in a turn. It won't trigger for the third, fourth, or so on. It also doesn't matter how many noncreature spells you cast in a turn; the ability counts only the creature spells.</Rulings>

<CardText>Each opponent can't draw more than one card each turn.
Whenever you or a permanent you control becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, you may draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Magali Villeneuve</Artist>
<Multiverseid>457126</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: Your opponents can draw a maximum of one card each on each player's turn. Subsequent card draws during that turn are ignored.
2018/12/07: If an opponent hasn't drawn any cards in a turn and a spell or ability instructs that player to draw multiple cards, that player will just draw one card. However, if the draws are optional, the player can't choose to draw, even if they could draw one card this way.
2018/12/07: Leovold will "see" cards drawn by opponents earlier in the turn before it entered the battlefield, although Leovold can't affect cards drawn before it entered the battlefield. For example, if an opponent draws two cards, then Leovold enters the battlefield, that opponent can't draw more cards that turn, but the two drawn cards are unaffected.
2018/12/07: Replacement effects (such as that of dredge or Laboratory Maniac's ability) can't be used to replace draws that Leovold disallows. However, if an opponent's first draw is replaced (by a dredge ability, for example), that draw didn't happen and Leovold won't stop the next draw.
2018/12/07: If you and a permanent you control each become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls, Leovold's ability will trigger twice. The same is true if two permanents you control become the target of the same spell or ability an opponent controls.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/05/01: A face-down creature has no name, so it doesn't have the same name as anything else.
2018/12/07: <Maelstrom Pulse> has only one target. Other permanents with the same name will be destroyed even if they have hexproof or protection.
2018/12/07: If the target permanent becomes an illegal target for <Maelstrom Pulse>, the spell doesn't resolve. Nothing is destroyed.
2018/12/07: The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types it was created with unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 red Elemental creature token created by Young Pyromancer and a 4/4 green Elemental creature token created by Walker of the Grove are both named "Elemental."

Spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause you to sacrifice permanents.</CardText>
<Artist>Chris Rahn</Artist>
<Multiverseid>457129</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent (as Desecration Demon does), you can't take that option.
2018/12/07: If a spell or ability an opponent controls states something happens unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Mogis, God of Slaughter does), you can't choose to sacrifice a permanent. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does), you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since you can't sacrifice any permanents.
2018/12/07: Sigarda's ability affects only sacrifices. It won't stop a creature from dying due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.</Rulings>

Persist (When this creature dies, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a -1/-1 counter on it.)</CardText>
<Artist>Kev Walker</Artist>
<Multiverseid>457131</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>457134</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2018/12/07: <Platinum Emperion>'s ability doesn't prevent damage. Rather, it changes the results of that damage. For example, if a creature with lifelink deals damage to you, you won't lose any life, but its controller will still gain that much life. Similarly, if a creature you control with lifelink deals damage to another player, that player will lose life but you won't gain any life.
2018/12/07: Abilities that trigger whenever damage is dealt to you will still trigger because that damage is still dealt, even though your life total doesn't change as a result.
2018/12/07: Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
2018/12/07: You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life. However, you can choose to be dealt damage, even though that damage won't result in your life total changing.
2018/12/07: If a cost would include causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
2018/12/07: Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other event won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life.
2018/12/07: Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will end up replacing the event with nothing.
2018/12/07: If an effect says to set your life total to a certain number, that part of the effect won't do anything.
2018/12/07: If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.
2018/12/07: In a Commander game, the damage dealt to you by commanders will still be counted, even if that damage doesn't cause you to lose life.</Rulings>
