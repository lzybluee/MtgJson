<Name>Gideon, Ally of Zendikar</Name>
<Type>Legendary Planeswalker — Gideon (Loyalty: 4)</Type>
<ManaCost>2WW (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>+1: Until end of turn, Gideon, Ally of Zendikar becomes a 5/5 Human Soldier Ally creature with indestructible that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn.
0: Create a 2/2 white Knight Ally creature token.
-4: You get an emblem with "Creatures you control get +1/+1."</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2015/08/25: Gideon's first ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Specifically, your rally abilities won't trigger. (Of course, Gideon's second ability will cause rally abilities to trigger.)
2015/08/25: If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his {T} abilities (if he gains any).
2015/08/25: Gideon's first ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human, Soldier, and Ally. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human, Soldier, and Ally are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
2015/08/25: If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his first ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.</Rulings>

<CardText>+1: Scry 1, then draw a card.
-2: Return target creature to its owner's hand.
-8: You get an emblem with "Whenever an opponent casts their first spell each turn, counter that spell."</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/04/08: The emblem's triggered ability counters the first spell an opponent casts on each turn, not just that opponent's turn.
2016/04/08: If Jace's emblem's triggered ability doesn't counter the first spell an opponent casts (perhaps because that spell can't be countered), it won't trigger again in the same turn to try to counter that player's second spell.
2016/04/08: If you have multiple opponents, Jace's emblem can trigger once each turn for each opponent.</Rulings>

-7: You get an emblem with "At the beginning of your end step, create X 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens, where X is two plus the number of Zombies you control."</CardText>
<Artist>Eric Deschamps</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/07/13: You can activate Liliana's first ability without any targets just to add a loyalty counter to her.
2016/07/13: Liliana's second ability doesn't target the card to return to your hand. After putting the top two cards of your library into your graveyard, you may choose from among any creature cards there.
2016/07/13: While resolving the triggered ability of Liliana's emblem, if you control zero Zombies, you'll get two Zombie tokens.</Rulings>

2016/04/08: For Chandra's second ability, it doesn't matter if the cards don't go to your graveyard because of a replacement effect. For example, cards with madness discarded this way will still count toward the number of cards you discarded.</Rulings>
