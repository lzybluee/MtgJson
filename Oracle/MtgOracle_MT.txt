Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

<Artist>Chuck Lukacs</Artist>
<Multiverseid>152934</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: Kinship is an ability word that indicates a group of similar triggered abilities that appear on _Morningtide_ creatures. It doesn't have any special rules associated with it.
2008/04/01: The first two sentences of every kinship ability are the same (except for the creature's name). Only the last sentence varies from one kinship ability to the next.
2008/04/01: You don't have to reveal the top card of your library, even if it shares a creature type with the creature that has the kinship ability.
2008/04/01: After the kinship ability finishes resolving, the card you looked at remains on top of your library.
2008/04/01: If you have multiple creatures with kinship abilities, each triggers and resolves separately. You'll look at the same card for each one, unless you have some method of shuffling your library or moving that card to a different zone.
2008/04/01: If the top card of your library is already revealed (due to Magus of the Future, for example), you still have the option to reveal it or not as part of a kinship ability's effect.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: Maralen prevents players from drawing cards for any reason, including as a cost, as an effect, and as a result of the "draw a card" turn-based action during the draw step.
2008/04/01: While Maralen is on the battlefield, no player can lose the game due to being instructed to draw a card with an empty library.
2008/04/01: While Maralen is on the battlefield, replacement effects that instruct a player to do something instead of drawing a card won't work.
2008/04/01: While Maralen is on the battlefield, a player can't choose to draw cards (or choose to have another player draw cards) as a spell or ability resolves. For example, if you cast the Development side of Research // Development ("Put a 3/1 red Elemental creature token onto the battlefield unless any opponent lets you draw a card. Repeat this process two more times."), you'll put three Elemental tokens onto the battlefield because your opponents can't "let you draw a card."

<Artist>Alex Horley-Orlandelli</Artist>
<Multiverseid>152571</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>152887</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/04/01: If you win the clash, the spell moves from the stack to your hand as part of its resolution. It never hits the graveyard. If you don't win the clash, the spell is put into the graveyard from the stack as normal.
2008/04/01: If the spell is countered or doesn't resolve for any reason (for example, if all its targets become illegal), none of its effects happen. There is no clash, and the spell card won't be returned to your hand.
2008/04/01: You put the revealed nonland cards on the bottom of your library before you clash.
2008/04/01: If you have only nonland cards in your library, you reveal your entire library (one card at a time), rearrange it however you like, and then clash.</Rulings>

<Artist>Jim Pavelec</Artist>
<Multiverseid>152625</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: <Reins of the Vinesteed>'s last ability triggers if it and the creature it's enchanting are both put into the graveyard at the same time, or if the creature it's enchanting is put into the graveyard but <Reins of the Vinesteed> isn't. (In the second case, <Reins of the Vinesteed> is then put into the graveyard as a state-based action.)
2008/04/01: As the triggered ability resolves, check which creatures on the battlefield have any of the creature types that the previously enchanted creature had as it left the battlefield. If that creature was a Goblin Rogue, for example, <Reins of the Vinesteed> can be returned to the battlefield attached to either a Goblin creature or a Rogue creature.
2008/04/01: This triggered ability doesn't target a creature. You may return <Reins of the Vinesteed> to the battlefield attached to a creature that has shroud, for example. However, the creature must be able to be legally enchanted by <Reins of the Vinesteed>. You can't return <Reins of the Vinesteed> to the battlefield attached to a creature that has protection from green, for example.
2008/04/01: You can choose to return <Reins of the Vinesteed> to the battlefield attached to a creature another player controls. You still control <Reins of the Vinesteed>. When that creature is put into a graveyard, the ability of <Reins of the Vinesteed> will trigger again and you'll be able choose another creature for the Aura to enchant.</Rulings>

<Artist>Todd Lockwood</Artist>
<Multiverseid>152553</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2008/04/01: Evoke doesn't change the timing of when you can cast the creature that has it. If you could cast that creature spell only when you could cast a sorcery, the same is true for cast it with evoke.
2008/04/01: If a creature spell cast with evoke changes controllers before it enters the battlefield, it will still be sacrificed when it enters the battlefield. Similarly, if a creature cast with evoke changes controllers after it enters the battlefield but before its sacrifice ability resolves, it will still be sacrificed. In both cases, the controller of the creature at the time it left the battlefield will control its leaves-the-battlefield ability.
2008/04/01: When you cast a spell by paying its evoke cost, its mana cost doesn't change. You just pay the evoke cost instead.
2008/04/01: Effects that cause you to pay more or less to cast a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its evoke cost, too. That's because they affect the total cost of the spell, not its mana cost.
2008/04/01: Whether evoke's sacrifice ability triggers when the creature enters the battlefield depends on whether the spell's controller chose to pay the evoke cost, not whether they actually paid it (if it was reduced or otherwise altered by another ability, for example).
2008/04/01: If you're casting a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't use its evoke ability.</Rulings>
