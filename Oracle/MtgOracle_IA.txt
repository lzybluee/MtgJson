<Rulings>2008/10/01: A card is "above" another card in your graveyard if it was put into that graveyard later.
2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Dance of the Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Dance of the Dead." Put enchanted creature card onto the battlefield tapped under your control and attach Dance of the Dead to it. When Dance of the Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.
At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, that player may pay {1}{B}. If the player does, untap that creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Randy Gallegos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>2442</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: If more than one <Dance of the Dead> ends up on a creature, each contributes a +1/+1. But you only have to pay the untap cost once. You may pay for each one, however, and untap the card more than once during upkeep.
2008/04/01: This is a new wording. <Dance of the Dead> is now an Aura. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to that card again (since the card is treated as a new object on the battlefield).
2008/04/01: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Dance of the Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Dance of the Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Dance of the Dead> to another creature won't work.
2008/04/01: If the creature card put onto the battlefield has protection from black (or anything that prevents this from legally being attached), this won't be able to attach to it. Then this will go to the graveyard as a state-based action, causing the creature to be sacrificed.</Rulings>

2008/08/01: If <Krovikan Vampire> isn't on the battlefield at the beginning of the end step, its ability won't trigger. No cards will be returned to the battlefield, even if <Krovikan Vampire> dealt damage to some creatures that died that turn.
2008/10/01: If a creature that <Krovikan Vampire> dealt damage to that turn dies in response to the triggered ability, that creature card will be put onto the battlefield. Note that an appropriate creature must have died prior to the beginning of the end step in order for the ability to trigger in the first place.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/09/16: The losses, discards, and sacrifices are rounded up. For example, if you have 5 life, you'll lose 2 life, leaving you at 3 life. (Five divided by three is one and two-thirds. Rounding that up to the nearest whole number gives you two.)
2007/09/16: Each part of <Pox>'s effect is processed separately. For each part, first the player whose turn it is makes all necessary choices (such as which cards to discard), then each other player in turn order chooses, then the actions happen at the same time. Then <Pox>'s effect moves to the next stage.
2007/09/16: The number you need to lose, discard, or sacrifice isn't calculated until it's time to perform that part of the effect. For example, if your opponent casts <Pox> and you discard Dodecapod as part of <Pox>'s discard effect, Dodecapod will be put onto the battlefield instead of into your graveyard. Then, when determining how many creatures you need to sacrifice, the Dodecapod is taken into account.</Rulings>

Cumulative upkeep—Sacrifice a land. (At the beginning of your upkeep, put an age counter on this permanent, then sacrifice it unless you pay its upkeep cost for each age counter on it.)</CardText>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Paying cumulative upkeep is always optional. If it's not paid, the permanent with cumulative upkeep is sacrificed. Partial payments of the total cumulative upkeep cost can't be made. For example, if a permanent with "cumulative upkeep {1}" has three age counters on it when its cumulative upkeep ability triggers, it gets another age counter and then its controller chooses to either pay {4} or sacrifice the permanent.</Rulings>

2008/10/01: The number of targets must be at least 1 and at most X + 1. You divide the damage as you cast <Meteor Shower>, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: You can't choose "colorless" as a color.
2009/10/01: <Call to Arms> affects all white creatures, not just white creatures you control.
2009/10/01: If <Call to Arms> changes controllers, it will continue to check the nontoken permanents controlled by the player chosen as it entered the battlefield, even if that player isn't an opponent of its current controller.
2009/10/01: The game continually counts the number of nontoken permanents of each color the chosen player controls. Multicolored ones are counted for each of their colors; colorless ones are ignored. The moment the number of nontoken permanents of the chosen color that player controls is less than or equal to the number of permanents of one of the other colors that player controls, <Call to Arms>'s second ability stops giving white creatures +1/+1 and its third ability triggers. <Call to Arms> will be sacrificed when the third ability resolves, even if those numbers have changed by then.
2009/10/01: <Call to Arms>'s third ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.</Rulings>

The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.

2004/10/04: If the Bottle leaves the battlefield or your control, the cards remain waiting until played or until the beginning of your next upkeep. The card is in the "Exile" zone.
2004/10/04: The card is not part of your hand in any way. You can't be forced to discard it due to a discard from hand effect, and you can't discard it to pay a cost.
2004/10/04: To "play a card" is to either cast a spell or to put a land onto the battlefield using the main phase special action.
2008/08/01: If you do not play the card before your next upkeep, it remains exiled; you just lose the ability to play it.
2008/10/01: The exiled card is played using the normal timing rules for its card type, as well as any other applicable restrictions such as "Cast [this card] only during combat." For example, you can't play the card during an opponent's turn unless it's an instant or has flash. Similarly, if the exiled card is a land, you can't play it if you've already played a land that turn. If it's a nonland card, you'll have to pay its mana cost. The only thing that's different is you're playing it from the Exile zone.</Rulings>

<CardText>{X}, {T}: Put a charge counter on Ice Cauldron and exile a nonland card from your hand. You may cast that card for as long as it remains exiled. Note the type and amount of mana spent to pay this activation cost. Activate this ability only if there are no charge counters on Ice Cauldron.
{T}, Remove a charge counter from Ice Cauldron: Add Ice Cauldron's last noted type and amount of mana. Spend this mana only to cast the last card exiled with Ice Cauldron.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Frazier</Artist>
<Multiverseid>2407</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: The Cauldron counts only mana spent on it. It doesn't see the value of X, so isn't affected by cost reductions. Thus, if you spent {C}{C}{R}{R} on X, you get {C}{C}{R}{R} later even if X was 6.
2004/10/04: Cards which are not actually in your hand can't be exiled by the <Ice Cauldron>.
2004/10/04: If multiple cards are exiled by the Cauldron, the mana can only be used for the card that was exiled by the Cauldron when the most recent charge counter was put there.
2004/10/04: The mana put in the Cauldron can only be used to cast the given spell, but you can add additional mana to a spell. This means you can pay part of the cost on one turn and the rest of it on the next turn.
2004/10/04: You do not have to use any mana from the Cauldron when casting the spell if you don't want to. You don't even have to tap the Cauldron and draw the mana, you can just cast the spell using mana from somewhere else.
2004/10/04: If multiple cards are exiled by the Cauldron, any one of them can be cast.
2004/10/04: If the ability to exile a card with the Cauldron is countered, you do not lose the card since it is exiled during resolution.
2004/10/04: It is possible to have more than one card exiled by the Cauldron. You can tap the Cauldron to remove the charge counter and whatever mana is on it but leave the card there. Later, you can tap it and put in mana and a charge counter to add another card.
2004/10/04: X can be zero. This places a zero mana counter on the Cauldron.
2004/10/04: You can only cast the spell when you could legally cast it normally. So no casting a sorcery on your opponent's turn.
2004/10/04: The mana can be used to pay for additional costs to cast the spell.
2004/10/04: If the Cauldron leaves the battlefield, you can still cast any cards it exiled as though they were in your hand. You just no longer have access to the mana you charged the Cauldron with.
2004/10/04: Tapping the Cauldron for the mana is a mana ability.
2004/10/04: Produces mana of the last type used to put a counter on itself, not via any other charge counters.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: Paying cumulative upkeep is always optional. If it's not paid, the permanent with cumulative upkeep is sacrificed. Partial payments of the total cumulative upkeep cost can't be made. For example, if a permanent with "cumulative upkeep {1}" has three age counters on it when its cumulative upkeep ability triggers, it gets another age counter and then its controller chooses to either pay {4} or sacrifice the permanent.</Rulings>

<Artist>Melissa A. Benson</Artist>
<Multiverseid>2724</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/03/14: You choose how many targets <Fiery Justice> has and how the damage is divided as you cast it. Each target for its damage-dealing effect must receive at least 1 damage.
2017/03/14: If some (but not all) of the targets become illegal, the original division of damage still applies, but no damage is dealt to illegal targets. If all targets become illegal, including the target opponent for the life-gaining effect, <Fiery Justice> doesn't resolve. If each target for the damage-dealing effect becomes illegal while the target for the life-gaining effect remains legal, that player gains 5 life even though no damage is dealt.
2017/03/14: The target opponent for the life-gaining effect may also be a target for the damage-dealing effect. If this happens and the damage brings that player's life total to 0 or less, the life-gaining effect will raise their life total above 0 again before the player would lose the game.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: It does not change the color of the source, so that things that trigger on a red spell doing damage will still trigger. The damage itself thinks it came from a colorless source, however.
2004/10/04: Does not make red and black spells and permanents colorless. They still have color. A red spell can't target a creature with Protection from Red due to this. The spells just act like colorless sources when dealing damage.
2004/10/04: If the source has more than one color but at least one is red or black, then the damage is colorless and all the other colors are forgotten.
2004/10/04: The effect is continuous and applies whenever something looks at the damage. If this card leaves the battlefield, damage from red and black spells will appear as its normal color. In other words, the color was not removed from the damage, the color just could not be determined while this card is in effect.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2009/10/01: <Kjeldoran Frostbeast>'s ability triggers only if it's still on the battlefield when the end of combat step begins (after the combat damage step). For example, if it blocks a 7/7 creature and is destroyed, its ability won't trigger at all. The 7/7 will remain on the battlefield.
2009/10/01: Its ability will destroy all creatures it's currently blocking or blocked by, not necessarily the creatures it had blocked or become blocked by during that combat phase. For example, if <Kjeldoran Frostbeast> is dealt lethal combat damage and regenerates, it's removed from combat. Its ability will trigger at end of combat, but since it's no longer blocking or blocked by any creatures, the ability won't do anything.</Rulings>
