<CardText>Each player chooses a number of lands they control equal to the number of lands controlled by the player who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players discard cards and sacrifice creatures the same way.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Poole</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: First the player whose turn it is chooses which lands (if any) to keep, then each other player in turn order does the same. Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them. All of the unchosen lands are then sacrificed simultaneously. Then the process is repeated for cards in hand, except that no cards are revealed until all players have chosen what to discard, at which point those cards are all discarded simultaneously. Lastly, the process is repeated for creatures, and players will again know earlier choices made when deciding what to sacrifice. All of the unchosen creatures are then sacrificed simultaneously.
2016/06/08: <Balance> doesn't have targets, so permanents that can't be targeted, such as a creature with shroud or protection from white, are valid choices to be sacrificed.
2016/06/08: Each type of object is counted during the corresponding part of the process. Cards in hand are counted after lands have been sacrificed, and creatures on the battlefield are counted after cards have been discarded. Thus, a land creature sacrificed to the first part of the spell would not be counted when determining how many creatures are on the battlefield for the last part.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kev Brockschmidt</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You do not lose life if this card is exiled or sent someplace without going to the graveyard first.
2004/10/04: The owner of the Incarnation loses life when it is destroyed, not the controller. So if you control your opponent's Incarnation you can let it die to make them lose life.
2007/02/01: If you attempt to halve a negative life total, you halve 0. This means that the life total stays the same. A life total of -10 would remain -10.</Rulings>

<Artist>Dennis Detwiller</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: Can target a card with no appropriate words on it, or even one with no words at all.
2004/10/04: It can't change a word to the same word. It must be a different word.
2004/10/04: It only changes what is printed on the card (or set on a token when it was created or set by a copy effect). It will not change any effects that are on the permanent.
2004/10/04: You choose the words to change on resolution.
2004/10/04: You can't change proper nouns (i.e. card names) such as "Island Fish Jasconius".
2004/10/04: Changing the text of a spell will not allow you to change the targets of the spell because the targets were chosen when the spell was cast. The text change will (probably) cause it to be countered since the targets will be illegal.
2004/10/04: If you change the text of a spell which is to become a permanent, the permanent will retain the text change until the effect wears off.
2004/10/04: It can be used to change a land's type from one basic land type to another. For example, Forest can be changed to Island so it produces blue mana. It doesn't change the name of any permanent.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: Since this is an instant, your opponent may use instants in response to the casting of this spell. Note that such spells and abilities will be resolved before the mana pool is emptied by the <Mana Short>. This makes it useless as a countermeasure for spells. To use it effectively, you need to use it during Upkeep and even then it will not prevent the use of instant spells and abilities.
2004/10/04: If you play <Mana Short> in response to a spell, it will have no effect on that spell since the mana has already been paid.</Rulings>

<CardText>Enchant creature card in a graveyard
When Animate Dead enters the battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put onto the battlefield with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.
Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.</CardText>
<Artist>Anson Maddocks</Artist>
<Rulings>2016/06/08: <Animate Dead> is an Aura, albeit with an unusual enchant ability. You target a creature card in a graveyard when you cast it. It enters the battlefield attached to that card. Then it returns that card to the battlefield, and attaches itself to the card again (since the card is a new object on the battlefield). <Animate Dead> itself never moves into a graveyard during this process.
2016/06/08: If <Animate Dead> isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, none of its effects happen. The creature card won't be returned to the battlefield.
2016/06/08: Abilities such as shroud and protection function only on the battlefield unless otherwise specified. A creature card with shroud may be targeted by <Animate Dead>, and <Animate Dead> will become attached to the creature that enters the battlefield.
2016/06/08: If the creature put onto the battlefield has protection from black—or if the creature can't legally be enchanted by <Animate Dead> for another reason—<Animate Dead> won't be able to attach to it. It will be put into the graveyard as a state-based action, causing its delayed triggered ability to trigger. When the trigger resolves, if the creature's still on the battlefield, its controller will sacrifice it.
2016/06/08: Once the creature is returned to the battlefield, <Animate Dead> can't be attached to anything other than it (unless <Animate Dead> somehow manages to put a different creature onto the battlefield). Attempting to move <Animate Dead> to another creature won't work.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: Since it enters the battlefield due to triggering at the beginning of upkeep, it is not possible to get an infinite loop with four <Nether Shadow>s.
2004/10/04: Note that bringing the Shadow back onto the battlefield from the graveyard is not a spell, it is an ability. It can't be countered with something that counters spells.
2008/10/01: Players may not rearrange the cards in their graveyards.
2008/10/01: The last thing that happens to a resolving instant or sorcery spell is that it's put into its owner's graveyard. Example: You cast Wrath of God. All creatures on the battlefield are destroyed. You arrange all the cards put into your graveyard this way in any order you want. The other players in the game do the same to the cards that are put into their graveyards. Then you put Wrath of God into your graveyard, on top of the other cards.
2008/10/01: Say you're the owner of both a permanent and an Aura that's attached to it. If both the permanent and the Aura are destroyed at the same time (by Akroma's Vengeance, for example), you decide the order they're put into your graveyard. If just the enchanted permanent is destroyed, it's put into your graveyard first. Then, after state-based actions are checked, the Aura (which is no longer attached to anything) is put into your graveyard on top of it.
2008/10/01: A card is "above" another card in your graveyard if it was put into that graveyard later.
2008/10/01: If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.</Rulings>

2017/11/17: You may cast <Fireball> with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
2017/11/17: <Fireball>'s damage is divided as <Fireball> resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as <Fireball> resolves.
2017/11/17: You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time <Fireball> resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.</Rulings>

2004/10/04: If the land produces more than one color of mana at a single time, its controller chooses which of those types is produced by <Mana Flare>'s ability.

2004/10/04: <Mana Flare> adds one of whatever color the land produces after applying any land type or color changing effects.

When the player finishes casting that spell or activating that ability, it's put on the stack, then <Manabarbs>'s triggered abilities are put on the stack on top of it. The <Manabarbs> abilities will resolve first.
2009/10/01: On the other hand, a player can tap lands for mana, let the <Manabarbs> triggered abilities be put on the stack, and then respond to those abilities by casting an instant or activating an ability using that mana. In that case, the spell or ability will resolve first.</Rulings>

Bands are blocked as a group.

<Artist>Jeff A. Menges</Artist>
<Rulings>2008/10/01: If a creature with banding attacks, it can team up with any number of other attacking creatures with banding (and up to one nonbanding creature) and attack as a unit called a "band." The band can be blocked by any creature that could block a single creature in the band. Blocking any creature in a band blocks the entire band. If a creature with banding is blocked, the attacking player chooses how the blockers' damage is assigned.
2008/10/01: A maximum of one nonbanding creature can join an attacking band no matter how many creatures with banding are in it.
2008/10/01: Creatures in the same band must all attack the same player or planeswalker.
2009/10/01: If a creature in combat has banding, its controller assigns damage for creatures blocking or blocked by it. That player can ignore the damage assignment order when making this assignment.</Rulings>

<CardText>{T}: Add one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls could produce.</CardText>
<Artist>Quinton Hoover</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.
2004/10/04: The ability can be activated if the opponent has no lands that produce mana, but the effect will not be able to generate any mana.
2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Fellwar Stone> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

<Artist>Daniel Gelon</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You can't use the <Library of Leng> ability to place a discarded card on top of your library when you discard a card as a cost, because costs aren't effects.
2004/10/04: The discard triggers anything else that triggers on discards.
2004/10/04: You can look at a randomly discarded card before deciding where it goes.
2004/10/04: This effect has no effect on the cards being put into the graveyard from a library, because they are not "discarded".
2004/10/04: If more than one card is discarded due to a single effect, the Library allows you to decide whether or not to use it on each of the cards. You get to decide the order the cards are placed on the library if more than one goes there.
2004/10/04: Since the card goes directly to the library, the card is not revealed unless the spell or ability requiring the discard specifically says it is.
2004/10/04: The ability replaces the normal discard action with a discard action that puts the card on the library instead of the graveyard.
2004/10/04: The ability applies any time a spell or ability has you discard as part of its effect. It does not matter if you or your opponent control the spell or ability. The discard is forced because it is an effect.
2009/10/01: If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put <Library of Leng> onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents entered the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.</Rulings>

At the beginning of the chosen player's upkeep, The Rack deals X damage to that player, where X is 3 minus the number of cards in their hand.</CardText>
<Artist>Richard Thomas</Artist>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: You choose one opposing player as this card enters the battlefield and it only affects that one player. This choice is not changed even if this card changes controllers. It becomes useless but stays on the battlefield if the chosen player leaves the game.</Rulings>

<Name>Triskelion</Name>
<Type>Artifact Creature — Construct 1/1</Type>
<ManaCost>6 (6)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Triskelion enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters on it.
Remove a +1/+1 counter from Triskelion: It deals 1 damage to any target.</CardText>
<Artist>Douglas Shuler</Artist>
<Rulings>2010/08/15: If you activate the ability of an attacking or blocking <Triskelion> during the declare blockers step, it will deal less combat damage as a result. If you wait until the combat damage step, but <Triskelion> is dealt lethal damage, it'll be destroyed before you get a chance to activate its ability.
2010/08/15: If <Triskelion> has damage marked on it, activating its ability may cause that damage to become lethal. For example, say a <Triskelion> with two +1/+1 counters on it has been dealt 2 damage earlier in the turn. If you activate its ability by removing a +1/+1 counter from it, it now has 2 toughness and is destroyed as a state-based action. You won't be able to remove the other +1/+1 counter from it to activate its ability again. The first activation of the ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<CardText>{0}: Urza's Avenger gets -1/-1 and gains your choice of banding, flying, first strike, or trample until end of turn. (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)</CardText>

{1}: Mishra's Factory becomes a 2/2 Assembly-Worker artifact creature until end of turn. It's still a land.
{T}: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Kaja Foglio & Phil Foglio</Artist>
<Rulings>2005/08/01: If another player takes control of the Factory while it is animated, that player keeps control until the control effect ends. They do not lose control just because the card stops being an Assembly-Worker. Note that Auras which steal cards will go to the graveyard if the permanent they enchant is no longer valid.
2008/08/01: A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
2009/10/01: Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number. However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.
2016/06/08: Once turned into a creature, <Mishra's Factory>'s last ability can target itself. If it's already blocking, this won't remove it from combat.
2016/06/08: If you turn <Mishra's Factory> into a creature but haven't controlled it continuously since your most recent turn began, you won't be able to activate its first or last ability.</Rulings>
