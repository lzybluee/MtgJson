<Flavor>"There is no justice when some profit and others go without."</Flavor>
<Artist>Bram Sels</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433242</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect applies to an instruction to draw more than one card before any replacement effects apply to individual cards drawn. For example, if you have a card with dredge in your graveyard, you can't dredge it before the effect of Divination is modified by <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect.
2017/08/25: Once a replacement effect has been applied to an event, it can't be applied again to the resulting events. For example, once <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect has modified the effect of a player's Divination, Thought Reflection can double that player's resulting card draw without <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect applying again.
2017/08/25: To determine whether a player is instructed to draw multiple once or instructed multiple times to draw one card, count how many times the word "draw" is used. <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect watches for one "draw" that instructs a player to draw multiple cards (including instructions to "draw a card for each. . .").
2017/08/25: If an effect puts cards into a player's hand without using the word "draw" at all, <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect doesn't apply.
2017/08/25: If two players each control an <Alms Collector> and an effect instructs them to each draw two or more cards, the replacement effect of each <Alms Collector> is applied and both players end up drawing two cards.
2017/08/25: If two players each control an <Alms Collector> and a third player would draw two or more cards, the third player chooses which <Alms Collector>'s replacement effect will apply, and therefore which of the first two players draws a card.</Rulings>

Exile Teferi's Protection.</CardText>
<Artist>Chase Stone</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433249</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on the "protection from" keyword ----------
2017/08/25: If a player has protection from everything, it means three things: 1) All damage that would be dealt to that player is prevented. 2) Auras can't be attached to that player. 3) That player can't be the target of spells or abilities.
2017/08/25: Nothing other than the specified events are prevented or illegal. An effect that doesn't target you could still cause you to discard cards, for example. Creatures can still attack you while you have protection from everything, although combat damage that they would deal to you will be prevented.
2017/08/25: Gaining protection from everything causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets you. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on what it means if your life total can't change ----------
2017/08/25: Spells and abilities that would normally cause you to gain or lose life still resolve while your life total can't change, but the life-gain or life-loss part simply has no effect.
2017/08/25: Protection from everything will usually prevent damage if it would be dealt to you, but some damage can't be prevented. In this case, because your life total also can't change, that damage has any other effects that it may have aside from causing you to lose that much life (such as effects from lifelink or infect) and triggers and effects can see that damage was dealt even though your life total didn't change.
2017/08/25: You can't pay a cost that includes the payment of any amount of life other than 0 life.
2017/08/25: If a cost includes causing you to gain life (like the alternative cost of an opponent's Invigorate does), that cost can't be paid.
2017/08/25: Effects that would replace having you gain life with some other event won't be able to be applied because it's impossible for you to gain life. The same is true for effects that would replace having you lose life with some other event.
2017/08/25: Effects that replace an event with having you gain life (like Words of Worship's effect does) or having you lose life will apply and end up replacing the event with nothing.
2017/08/25: If an effect would set your life total to a certain number that's different than your current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything.
2017/08/25: If an effect would cause you to exchange life totals with another player, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total changes.
2017/08/25: ---------- The following rulings focus on the phasing keyword ----------
2017/08/25: While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
2017/08/25: Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
2017/08/25: Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Banishing Light, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
2017/08/25: Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Mathas, Fiend Seeker ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
2017/08/25: Each Aura and Equipment that phases out attached to a permanent that's phasing out phases in with that permanent and still attached to it.
2017/08/25: Each Aura and Equipment you control attached to a permanent that isn't phasing out phases in attached to that permanent if it can still be attached to that permanent. If not, it phases in unattached. An Aura that phases in unattached will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. The same is true with Auras attached to players.
2017/08/25: Permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
2017/08/25: Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
2017/08/25: If a token is phased out, it will phase in as your next untap step begins. This is a change from previous rules.
2017/08/25: A permanent phasing out causes a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target if it targets that permanent. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
2017/08/25: If your untap step is somehow skipped as your next turn begins, your phased-out permanents won't phase in until the next untap step you actually have, but you'll no longer have protection from everything and your life total can change again.
2017/08/25: Any creatures that phase in under your control as your next untap step begins will be able to attack and pay a cost of {T} during that turn.
2017/08/25: If you gain control of another player's permanent and it phases out, if the duration of the control-change effect expires before it phases in, that permanent phases in under that other player's control as your next untap step begins. If you leave the game before your next untap step, it phases in as the next untap step begins after your turn would have begun.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: To pay the additional cost of <New Blood>, you may tap any untapped Vampire you control, including one you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn. (Note that tapping the creature doesn't use {T} [the tap symbol].)
2017/08/25: <New Blood> changes the creature type each time it appears in the creature's type line and/or rules text. It doesn't change the name of the card or any instances of the word being used as part of a card's name.
2017/08/25: You choose what word you're changing as <New Blood> resolves. You don't have to choose a word that appears in the creature's text.
2017/08/25: The creature you gain control of won't be a Vampire if you don't choose a creature type in that creature's type line as one to replace.
2017/08/25: <New Blood>'s effect changes only the text printed on the creature. It can't change words found in abilities it's been granted. For example, if you change Rat to Vampire on Hungry Lynx, your Cats will have protection from Vampires; but if instead you change Rat to Vampire on Phantom Nishoba while you control a Hungry Lynx, Phantom Nishoba will have protection from Rats.
2017/08/25: The type-changing effect can change part of a word (such as "non-Human") if the part of the word is being used to refer to a creature type.
2017/08/25: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Cat. Card types such as "artifact" can't be chosen.

2017/08/25: If <Patron of the Vein> and a creature an opponent controls die simultaneously (perhaps because they fought or were in combat together), <Patron of the Vein>'s last ability triggers, but <Patron of the Vein> won't be on the battlefield as that ability resolves. It can't be saved by the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on it. The same is true of any other Vampires you control that die at the same time.

2017/08/25: If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
2017/08/25: If the creature doesn't meet any of the above exceptions and can attack, it must attack a player other than the controller of the spell or ability that goaded it if able. It the creature can't attack any of those players but could otherwise attack, it must attack an opposing planeswalker (controlled by any opponent) or the player who goaded it.
2017/08/25: Attacking with a goaded creature doesn't cause it to stop being goaded. If there is an additional combat phase that turn, or if another player gains control of that creature before it stops being goaded, it must attack again if able.
2017/08/25: If a creature you control has been goaded by multiple opponents, it must attack one of your opponents who hasn't goaded it, as that fulfills the maximum number of goad requirements. If a creature you control has been goaded by each of your opponents, you choose which opponent it attacks.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: <Edgar Markov>'s last ability puts a +1/+1 counter on each Vampire you control, including itself and Vampires you control that aren't attacking.
2017/08/25: Three eminence abilities are triggered abilities. That creature must be on the battlefield or in the command zone as the trigger event occurs and also as the triggered ability resolves. If the creature is in an appropriate zone as the trigger event occurs but leaves that zone, the ability won't do anything as it resolves.
2017/08/25: Notably, if your commander is on the battlefield and its eminence ability triggers, but it's put into the command zone before that ability resolves, that ability won't do anything as it resolves. This is because an object that changes zones is considered a new object.</Rulings>

2017/08/25: The token copies exactly what was printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature was copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.

2017/08/25: If the creature that caused Inalla's ability to trigger has already left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, you can still pay {1}. If you do, you'll create a token with the copiable values of the characteristics of that creature as it last existed on the battlefield.
2017/08/25: If a copied creature is legendary, any triggered abilities it has will trigger if appropriate before the "legend rule" causes one of those legendary creatures to be put into its owner's graveyard. Those abilities will be put on the stack after the "legend rule" is applied.
2017/08/25: To activate Inalla's last ability, you may tap any untapped Wizards you control, including ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, such as Inalla itself. (Note that tapping the creature doesn't use {T} [the tap symbol].)
2017/08/25: Three eminence abilities are triggered abilities. That creature must be on the battlefield or in the command zone as the trigger event occurs and also as the triggered ability resolves.

<Rulings>2017/08/25: Licia's first ability reduces only generic mana in its cost. It can't reduce the cost below {R}{W}{B}.
2017/08/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as the "commander tax"), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2017/08/25: Licia's first ability checks how much life you've gained during the turn, not what your life total is compared to what it was when the turn began. For example, if you start the turn at 30 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 10 life later that turn, Licia still costs {6} less to cast.

<ManaCost>1UBR (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>When Mairsil, the Pretender enters the battlefield, you may exile an artifact or creature card from your hand or graveyard and put a cage counter on it.
Mairsil, the Pretender has all activated abilities of all cards you own in exile with cage counters on them. You may activate each of those abilities only once each turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Izzy</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433282</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: If another player gains control of Mairsil, it will have the abilities of only cards that player owns in exile with cage counters on them.
2017/08/25: Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Mairsil won't gain triggered abilities (which start with "when," "whenever," or "at").
2017/08/25: If an activated ability of a card in exile with a cage counter on it references the card it's printed on by name, treat Mairsil's instance of that ability as though it referenced Mairsil by name instead. For instance, if Mairsil exiles Magus of the Mind, the cost to activate the ability includes sacrificing Mairsil, not sacrificing Magus of the Mind.
2017/08/25: If one of Mairsil's abilities doesn't resolve, most likely because its target became illegal before it resolved, it can't be activated again in the same turn.
2017/08/25: If multiple cards exiled with cage counters on them have the same ability, Mairsil will have multiple instances of that ability. Each may be activated once each turn.
2017/08/25: If you have a creature enter the battlefield as a copy of Mairsil, its first ability triggers. You won't be able to activate any abilities before the "legend rule" applies, but the triggered ability will still let you exile another card with a cage counter regardless of which Mairsil you keep.
2017/08/25: If Mairsil gains an activated ability that's normally linked to a non-activated ability of the card it came from, the ability Mairsil has isn't linked to any ability. For example, if Mairsil exiles Prototype Portal, the activated ability creates no tokens at all; it doesn't create Prototype Portal tokens.
2017/08/25: If Mairsil gains an activated ability that's normally linked to another activated ability of the card it came from, those two abilities Mairsil gains are linked for as long as Mairsil remains on the battlefield. For example, if Mairsil exiles Izzet Chemister, cards exiled with the first ability Mairsil gained from Izzet Chemister can be cast if you activate the second ability it gained that way. Izzet Chemister itself can't be cast this way, and if Mairsil leaves the battlefield before activating that second ability, the cards exiled with that first ability are lost forever.
2017/08/25: If Mairsil has a crew ability, creatures can crew Mairsil. It'll become an artifact creature, but its power and toughness remain unchanged.
2017/08/25: If Mairsil has an equip ability, activating it won't cause anything to happen. Mairsil doesn't become attached to a creature. They may remain friends.
2017/08/25: The exiled cards remain exiled with cage counters when Mairsil leaves the battlefield. If Mairsil returns to the battlefield, it will see all of those exiled cards with cage counters on them.</Rulings>

2017/08/25: If Mathas's ability resolves two separate times targeting the same creature, that creature will have two instances of the triggered ability. Each triggers separately when that creature dies.

Once the card is exiled, rebound's delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of your next upkeep even if you no longer control Taigam.
2017/08/25: If Taigam is killed in response to you casting a spell, the ability will still trigger and your spell will gain rebound if Taigam attacked.
2017/08/25: Casting the card again due to rebound's delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
2017/08/25: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (either because another spell or ability counters it or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.
2017/08/25: If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2017/08/25: If a spell moves itself into another zone as part of its resolution (as Teferi's Protection, All Suns' Dawn, and Beacon of Unrest do), rebound won't get a chance to apply.
2017/08/25: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. A spell you cast this way resolves before you can cast the next one, so one rebounded spell can't target another. Timing permissions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
2017/08/25: If you cast a card from exile, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: If you don't reveal a creature card that shares a type with the creature that died, you'll just reveal and randomize your library.
2017/08/25: If the equipped creature has no creature type, no card can share a creature type with it.
2017/08/25: You'll reveal cards until you find one that shares at least one creature type with the creature that died. For example, if a Cat Wizard dies, you'll stop if you reveal a Human Wizard or Cat Soldier.
2017/08/25: Compare the revealed cards to the creature as it last existed before it died, not to the creature card as it exists in its owner's graveyard, to determine which one you put into your hand.
2017/08/25: "Artifact" isn't a creature type.
2017/08/25: If <Heirloom Blade> leaves the battlefield at the same time that the equipped creature dies, its triggered ability triggers.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: The effect of <Herald's Horn> reduces only generic mana in a spell's cost. If that cost has no generic mana, the cost isn't reduced.
2017/08/25: To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
2017/08/25: If you don't put the top card of your library into your hand, you put it back on top of your library without revealing it. You'll draw it in that turn's draw step.
2017/08/25: If you somehow control a <Herald's Horn> with no chosen creature type, no spells will cost less to cast, not even creature spells with no creature type. You'll be able to look at the top card of your library at the beginning of each of your upkeeps, but you can never put it into your hand this way, even if it's a creature card with no creature type.
2017/08/25: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Cat. Card types such as "artifact" can't be chosen.
2017/08/25: You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Cat Warrior." A Cat Warrior is both a Cat and a Warrior. It's affected by anything that affects either type and unaffected by things that affect non-Cat or non-Warrior creatures.</Rulings>

<Artist>Kieran Yanner</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433295</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: Once the second ability of <Mirror of the Forebears> resolves, it no longer has that ability.
2017/08/25: <Mirror of the Forebears> copies the printed values of the target creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target creature become a creature.
2017/08/25: <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes an artifact in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> copies a creature that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
2017/08/25: If you activate the second ability of <Mirror of the Forebears> multiple times in a turn in response to itself, then each time one of those abilities resolves, it will overwrite whatever <Mirror of the Forebears> is copying. <Mirror of the Forebears> will wind up as a copy of the permanent targeted by the last ability to resolve. When the turn ends, all instances of the ability will wear off at the same time.
2017/08/25: If an effect begins to apply to <Mirror of the Forebears> before it becomes a copy of another permanent, that effect will continue to apply. For example, if <Mirror of the Forebears> is activated twice in response to itself targeting first Spirit of the Hearth then Temur Sabertooth, the ability it has while it's a copy of Temur Sabertooth can be activated and its effect will continue to apply while <Mirror of the Forebears> is a copy of Spirit of the Hearth.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes a creature the same turn it enters the battlefield, you can't attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (if it gains any) unless it has haste.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes a copy of a legendary creature you control, you'll put one of them into your graveyard.
2017/08/25: If you somehow control a <Mirror of the Forebears> with no chosen creature type, its activated ability can't be activated.
2017/08/25: If <Mirror of the Forebears> becomes a copy of a creature that itself has an ability that asks you to choose a creature type as it enters the battlefield and another ability that references "the chosen creature type," that ability won't have a choice made for it. You won't use the type chosen for <Mirror of the Forebears>.
2017/08/25: You must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Cat. Card types such as "artifact" can't be chosen.
2017/08/25: You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Cat Warrior." A Cat Warrior is both a Cat and a Warrior. It's affected by anything that affects either type and unaffected by things that affect non-Cat or non-Warrior creatures.</Rulings>

<Artist>Joseph Meehan</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433296</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2017/08/25: Ramos's triggered ability counts the number of colors a spell has (from zero to five), not how many colored mana symbols are there in its mana cost or how many colors of mana you spent.
2017/08/25: If you cast a colorless spell, Ramos's triggered ability triggers, but it won't get any +1/+1 counters.
2017/08/25: Ramos's triggered ability doesn't trigger until you've finished casting a spell, including paying all of its costs. If Ramos has fewer than five +1/+1 counters on it, there's no way to add counters with a spell and pay for that spell with the newly-added counters.
2017/08/25: Ramos's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve even if that spell is countered. If that spell is countered, use its last known information to determine what colors it was.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2017/08/25: The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or an effect changes your commander's color.
2017/08/25: Your commander's creature types are checked immediately after you cast a creature spell spending mana from <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability. They aren't set before the game begins, and they may not be the same types your commander had when you activated that ability.
2017/08/25: If you cast your commander with mana from <Path of Ancestry>, and your commander hasn't somehow lost all of its creature types while on the stack, you'll scry 1.
2017/08/25: If mana from <Path of Ancestry> is spent to cast a creature spell that shares a type with your commander, you'll scry 1 before that spell resolves.
2017/08/25: If your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or is phased out, it's considered to have no creature types.
2017/08/25: If your commander has no creature types, it can't share a creature type with any spell that you cast.
2017/08/25: If <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability produces two mana (most likely due to Mana Reflection), you'll scry 1 twice if you spend those two mana to cast one creature spell that shares a type with your commander. You won't scry 2. You'll also scry 1 twice if you spend this mana to cast two creature spells that each share a type with your commander.
2017/08/25: On the other hand, if an ability triggers when you tap <Path of Ancestry> for mana and produces more mana (such as that of Zendikar Resurgent or Mirari's Wake), you'll scry 1 only once when you spend those two mana.
2017/08/25: If your commander is a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth that has no colors in its color identity, <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability produces no mana.
2017/08/25: In formats other than Commander, <Path of Ancestry>'s last ability produces no mana.</Rulings>

2011/01/01: Paying {2} to ignore <Leonin Arbiter>'s effect is a special action. Any player may take this special action any time they have priority. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2011/01/01: Paying {2} doesn't let a player pick up a library and search it — it just allows them to ignore <Leonin Arbiter>'s effect that turn. That player can search a library only if another spell or ability instructs them to do so.

<Rulings>2019/06/14: An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker or put onto the battlefield attacking during a turn's combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat.
2019/06/14: If you cast <Wing Shards> after combat damage has been dealt, only creatures that survived combat can be sacrificed.
2019/06/14: <Wing Shards> doesn't target the creature to be sacrificed. The target player chooses the creature as it resolves.

<Rulings>2015/02/25: The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
2015/02/25: A token that enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down creature is a face-up colorless 2/2 creature with no name, abilities, or creature types.
2015/02/25: Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
2015/02/25: If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
2015/02/25: If the copied creature is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
2015/02/25: If the copied creature is a token, the token created by <Clone Legion> copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
2015/02/25: Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
2015/02/25: Remember that if you control more than one legendary permanent with the same name, you'll choose one to remain on the battlefield and put the rest into their owners' graveyards.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Winters</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433020</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The "Khans" ability happens after you draw the card you normally draw during your draw step. That card and the additional card will be in your hand when you have to discard a card.
2014/11/24: The "Dragons" ability adds {2} per spell, not per target. It won't cause a spell to cost more than {2} more to cast, even if that spell targets you and a permanent you control or more than one permanent you control.
2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

<Multiverseid>433022</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/07/18: Creatures that enter the battlefield or come under the target player's control after <Polymorphist's Jest> resolves won't be affected.
2014/07/18: The creatures will lose all other colors and creature types, but they will retain any other card types (such as artifact) or supertypes (such as legendary) they may have.
2014/07/18: <Polymorphist's Jest> overwrites all previous effects that set the creatures' base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after <Polymorphist's Jest> resolves will overwrite this effect.
2014/07/18: <Polymorphist's Jest> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
2014/07/18: If one of the affected creatures gains an ability after <Polymorphist's Jest> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2014/07/18: Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creatures no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change their power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
2014/07/18: If one of the Theros block Gods is affected by <Polymorphist's Jest>, it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities. If it stops being a creature, perhaps because your devotion to its color(s) decreased, it will be a legendary blue enchantment with no abilities. The way continuous effects work, the God's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes that ability is applied.</Rulings>

<Artist>Howard Lyon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433023</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
2014/11/24: Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any copy effects or type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2014/11/24: If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
2014/11/24: Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
2014/11/24: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
2014/11/24: Because face-down creatures don't have names, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
2014/11/24: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
2014/11/24: Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
2014/11/24: At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect allows you to or instructs you to.
2014/11/24: If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
2014/11/24: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
2014/11/24: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
2014/11/24: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2010/03/01: When the triggered ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creature they will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
2010/03/01: If multiple creatures you control (possibly including <Butcher of Malakir> itself) are put into their owners' graveyards at the same time, <Butcher of Malakir>'s triggered ability will trigger that many times.
2010/03/01: If you control more than one <Butcher of Malakir> and a creature you control is put into a graveyard, each of those Butchers' abilities will trigger. Each opponent will sacrifice a creature each time one of those abilities resolves.

Rebound (If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)</CardText>
<Artist>Trevor Claxton</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433037</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2010/06/15: If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand doesn't resolve for any reason (due being countered by a spell like Cancel, or because all of its targets are illegal), rebound has no effect. The spell is simply put into your graveyard. You won't get to cast it again next turn.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from anywhere other than your hand (such as from your graveyard due to Sins of the Past, from your library due to cascade, or from your opponent's hand due to Sen Triplets), rebound won't have any effect. If you do cast it from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost (for example, if you cast it from your hand due to Maelstrom Archangel).
2010/06/15: If a replacement effect would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere else instead of your graveyard (such as Leyline of the Void might), you choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
2010/06/15: Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
2010/06/15: If you cast a spell with rebound from your hand and it resolves, it isn't put into your graveyard. Rather, it's exiled directly from the stack. Effects that care about cards being put into your graveyard won't do anything.
2010/06/15: At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as the one from Rule of Law).
2010/06/15: If you are unable to cast a card from exile this way, or you choose not to, nothing happens when the delayed triggered ability resolves. The card remains exiled for the rest of the game, and you won't get another chance to cast the card. The same is true if the ability is countered (due to Stifle, perhaps).
2010/06/15: If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to your graveyard when it resolves, fails to resolve, or is countered. It won't go back to exile.
2010/06/15: The sacrificed creature's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its toughness.
2010/06/15: If the targeted player doesn't sacrifice a creature (because the player didn't control any creatures or due to Tajuru Preserver, perhaps), you gain no life.</Rulings>

2012/05/01: If an activated ability of a card in exile references the card it's printed on by name, treat <Dark Impostor>'s version of that ability as though it referenced <Dark Impostor> by name instead. For example, if Marrow Bats (which says "Pay 4 life: Regenerate Marrow Bats") is exiled with <Dark Impostor>, <Dark Impostor> has the ability "Pay 4 life: Regenerate <Dark Impostor>."
2012/05/01: <Dark Impostor> can target and exile a permanent that's only a creature temporarily, like an animated land. However, because that card isn't a creature card, <Dark Impostor> won't have any of that card's activated abilities.

<Rulings>2015/08/25: The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
2015/08/25: Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
2015/08/25: If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost {1} more to cast, you could pay {W}{U}{B}{R} to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
2015/08/25: If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
2015/08/25: If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

Persist (When this creature dies, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a -1/-1 counter on it.)</CardText>
<Artist>Daren Bader</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433053</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2013/06/07: If a creature with persist stops being a creature, persist will still work.
2013/06/07: The persist ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a -1/-1 counter on it.
2013/06/07: If a permanent has multiple instances of persist, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
2013/06/07: If a token with no -1/-1 counters on it has persist, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
2013/06/07: When a permanent with persist returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
2013/06/07: If multiple creatures with persist are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's persist creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's persist creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
2013/06/07: If a creature with persist that has +1/+1 counters on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, persist won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because persist checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/07: Lieutenant abilities apply only if your commander is on the battlefield and under your control.
2014/11/07: Lieutenant abilities refer only to whether you control your commander, not any other player's commander.
2014/11/07: If you gain control of a creature with a lieutenant ability owned by another player, that ability will check to see if you control your commander and will apply if you do. It won't check whether its owner controls their commander.
2014/11/07: If you lose control of your commander, lieutenant abilities of creatures you control will immediately stop applying. If this causes a creature's toughness to become less than or equal to the amount of damage marked on it, the creature will be destroyed.
2014/11/07: If a triggered ability granted by a lieutenant ability triggers, and in response to that trigger you lose control of your commander (causing the lieutenant to lose that ability), that triggered ability will still resolve.</Rulings>

<CardText>If you would draw a card, you may instead choose land or nonland and reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a card of the chosen kind. Put that card into your hand and put all other cards revealed this way on the bottom of your library in any order.</CardText>
<Artist>Rebecca Guay</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433077</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2004/10/04: This replacement effect replaces the draw, so nothing that triggers on a draw will trigger.
2004/10/04: If you use this on a multi-card draw, each replaced draw is handled separately. In other words, you reveal and then put on the bottom of the library for the first card, then do the same for the second, and so on. In a multi-card draw you do not have to choose how many of those draws will be replaced before you do any drawing or use of this card.
2004/10/04: If no card of the chosen type is found before your library empties, you don't get a card, but you do get to order all the cards in your library any way you choose.
2007/07/15: If your library is empty, <Abundance> can prevent you from losing the game for being unable to draw a card. If an effect or turn-based action would cause you to draw a card, you can replace that draw with <Abundance>'s replacement effect. (It doesn't matter that you'd be unable to actually draw a card.) Since <Abundance>'s effect has you put a card into your hand instead of drawing a card, you'll never be forced to draw a card with an empty library.</Rulings>

<Artist>James Ryman</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433082</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2014/11/24: The "Khans" ability triggers at the beginning of both your precombat main phase and your postcombat main phase. Unused mana empties from players' mana pools at the end of each step and phase.
2014/11/24: For the "Dragons" ability, you decide whether the creature with flying will fight the target creature you don't control as the ability resolves.
2014/11/24: Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
2014/11/24: The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
2014/11/24: Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.</Rulings>

For each instance of the ability, you'll determine which creature to put +1/+1 counters on as it resolves. Specifically, the creature you control with the lowest toughness as the first such ability resolves may not have the lowest toughness as the second such ability resolves.
2014/11/24: Bolster itself doesn't target any creature, though some spells and abilities that bolster may have other effects that target creatures. For example, you could put counters on a creature with protection from white with Abzan Skycaptain's bolster ability.
2014/11/24: You determine which creature to put counters on as the spell or ability that instructs you to bolster resolves.</Rulings>

2012/10/01: When the second ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
2012/10/01: The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
2012/10/01: If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
2012/10/01: If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Sphinx's Revelation does), the copy has the same value of X.
2012/10/01: You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you copy a spell that you cast by paying its overload cost, the copy will resolve as though its overload cost had been paid as well.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2014/11/24: The creatures affected by Silumgar's triggered ability are determined relative to the Dragon that attacked. For example, if Silumgar attacked one opponent and two other Dragons attacked another opponent, creatures controlled by the first opponent would get -1/-1 until end of turn and creatures controlled by the second opponent would get -2/-2 until end of turn.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2015/02/25: You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can't be changed.
2015/02/25: You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren't chosen. For example, you can cast Ojutai's Command without targeting a creature spell provided you don't choose the third mode.
2015/02/25: As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of Ojutai's Command, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won't matter in most cases.)
2015/02/25: If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets for the copy, but you can't choose new modes.
2015/02/25: If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2004/10/04: This works even if the opponent's lands are tapped. It only checks what kinds of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are usable right now.
2004/10/04: The ability can be activated if the opponent has no lands that produce mana, but the effect will not be able to generate any mana.
2004/10/04: It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
2009/10/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Fellwar Stone> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Fellwar Stone>, you can tap <Fellwar Stone> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/10/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, take into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there is more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/10/01: <Fellwar Stone> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.</Rulings>

2009/10/01: If you choose to have the targeted creature block the creature that was equipped with <Grappling Hook>, but it isn't able to do so as blockers are declared (for example, because the attacking creature has flying and the targeted creature doesn't), the requirement to block does nothing. The targeted creature is free to block whichever creature its controller chooses, or block no creatures at all.
2009/10/01: Tapped creatures, creatures that can't block as the result of an effect, creatures with unpaid costs to block (such as those from War Cadence), and creatures that aren't controlled by the defending player are exempt from effects that would require them to block. Such creatures can be targeted by the ability, but the requirement to block does nothing.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2008/10/01: That player loses half their life after combat damage has been subtracted from the player's life total. The amount of life the player loses is determined as the triggered ability resolves.
2008/10/01: If multiple <Quietus Spike>s trigger at the same time, that player loses half their life when the first ability resolves, then loses half of the remainder when the next ability resolves, and so on. The player does not lose the same amount each time.
2010/06/15: In a Two-Headed Giant game, after combat damage is dealt, <Quietus Spike> looks at that player's life total (which is the same as the team's life total) when determining how much life the team will lose, which basically means the team's life total is halved. Here's an example of the math: The team has 19 life, so the player has 19 life. <Quietus Spike> causes the team to lose 10 life (19 divided by 2, rounded up). The team's life total becomes 9 (19 minus 10).</Rulings>

<Artist>James Paick</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433157</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2011/01/01: If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying of something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.
2011/01/01: <Steel Hellkite>'s last ability destroys only nonland permanents whose converted mana cost is exactly equal to X, and only those controlled by players who have been dealt combat damage by <Steel Hellkite> this turn.
2011/01/01: It doesn't matter who controlled those permanents at the time <Steel Hellkite> dealt combat damage, or if those permanents were even on the battlefield at that time.
2011/01/01: You may activate the last ability even if <Steel Hellkite> hasn't dealt combat damage to any players that turn. If you do, the ability won't do anything.
2011/01/01: If <Steel Hellkite>'s third ability is activated with X equal to 0, it will destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost 0 the appropriate players control.
2011/01/01: The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner, unless it's copying something else (see below). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost {3}{U}{U} has converted mana cost 5.
2011/01/01: If a permanent is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.
2011/01/01: In all cases, ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the permanent was cast.
2011/01/01: If the mana cost of a permanent includes {X}, X is considered to be 0.</Rulings>

—Pulan, Bant orchardist</Flavor>
<Artist>Steven Belledin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>433181</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2009/02/01: The colors of mana are white, blue, black, red, and green. <Exotic Orchard> can't be tapped for colorless mana, even if a land an opponent controls could produce colorless mana.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands your opponents control, but it doesn't check their costs. For example, Vivid Crag has the ability "{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Crag: Add one mana of any color." If an opponent controls Vivid Crag and you control <Exotic Orchard>, you can tap <Exotic Orchard> for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether Vivid Crag has a charge counter on it, and it doesn't matter whether it's untapped.
2009/02/01: When determining what colors of mana your opponents' lands could produce, <Exotic Orchard> takes into account any applicable replacement effects that would apply to those lands' mana abilities (such as Contamination's effect, for example). If there are more than one, consider them in any possible order.
2009/02/01: <Exotic Orchard> doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your opponents' lands (such as Ancient Ziggurat or Hall of the Bandit Lord) put on the mana they produce. It just cares about colors of mana.
2009/02/01: Lands that produce mana based only on what other lands "could produce" won't help each other unless some other land allows one of them to actually produce some type of mana. For example, if you control an <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, none of those lands would produce mana if their mana abilities were activated. On the other hand, if you control a Forest and an <Exotic Orchard>, and your opponent controls an <Exotic Orchard> and a Reflecting Pool, then each of those lands can be tapped to produce {G}. Your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G} because you control a Forest. Your <Exotic Orchard> and your opponent's Reflecting Pool can each produce {G} because your opponent's <Exotic Orchard> can produce {G}.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2013/10/17: The "number of times it's been cast from the command zone" includes the most recent time. For example, the first time you cast your commander from the command zone in a game, if you spent mana from <Opal Palace>'s last ability to do so, it will enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter.
2013/10/17: The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or an effect changes your commander's color.
2013/10/17: If your commander is a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth that has no colors in its color identity, <Opal Palace>'s last ability produces no mana.
