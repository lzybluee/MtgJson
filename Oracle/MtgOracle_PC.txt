<CardText>Benalish Commander's power and toughness are each equal to the number of Soldiers you control.
Suspend X—{X}{W}{W}. X can't be 0. (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {X}{W}{W} and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
Whenever a time counter is removed from Benalish Commander while it's exiled, create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token.</CardText>

<Rulings>2007/02/01: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "play this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.</Rulings>

<CardText>Aeon Chronicler's power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand.
Suspend X—{X}{3}{U}. X can't be 0. (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {X}{3}{U} and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
Whenever a time counter is removed from Aeon Chronicler while it's exiled, draw a card.</CardText>
<Artist>Dan Dos Santos</Artist>
<Multiverseid>122449</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "play this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.</Rulings>

When the last time counter is removed from Veiling Oddity while it's exiled, creatures can't be blocked this turn.</CardText>
<Artist>Dave DeVries</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126806</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: Regardless of which order those abilities resolve in, <Veiling Oddity> can't be blocked that turn. The ability affects all creatures, not just the creatures that were on the battlefield when it resolved.
2007/02/01: If <Veiling Oddity> is suspended and the last time counter is removed during another player's turn, that player's creatures can't be blocked that turn, too.
2007/02/01: If <Veiling Oddity> is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "cast this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/02/01: <Ovinize> doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, you can't cast this fast enough to stop a creature's "At the beginning of your upkeep" or "When this creature enters the battlefield" abilities from triggering, since they trigger before players get priority.
2007/02/01: If the affected creature gains an ability after <Ovinize> resolves, it will keep that ability.
2007/02/01: If a face-down creature is affected by <Ovinize>, it won't be able to be turned face up for its morph cost. If some other effect turns it face up, it will remain a 0/1 creature with no abilities until the turn ends. Its "When this creature turns face up" or "As this creature turns face up" abilities won't work.
2007/02/01: <Ovinize> can be used to disable a creature's vanishing ability permanently by casting it in response to the vanishing upkeep trigger when there's one time counter left. The last time counter will be removed as that ability resolves, but since the creature no longer has vanishing, the "sacrifice" triggered ability won't exist. When <Ovinize>'s effect ends and the creature regains vanishing, its triggered ability will no longer be able to trigger because it has no time counters.
2007/02/01: If <Ovinize> affects Mistform Ultimus, the Ultimus will lose its ability that says "Mistform Ultimus is every creature type," but it will still *be* all creature types. The way continuous effects work, Mistform Ultimus's type-changing ability is applied before <Ovinize>'s ability removes it.

<Rulings>2007/02/01: When this spell is cast, its "when you cast" ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of it.
2007/02/01: As the triggered ability resolves, the active player gets the option to perform the action. If that player declines, the next player in turn order gets the option. As soon as any player performs the action, the spell is countered, but the remaining players still get the option. If all players decline, the spell remains on the stack.
2013/07/01: A player can't choose to pay 5 life unless they actually have 5 or more life to pay.</Rulings>

<CardText>Roiling Horror's power and toughness are each equal to your life total minus the life total of an opponent with the most life.
Suspend X—{X}{B}{B}{B}. X can't be 0. (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {X}{B}{B}{B} and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
Whenever a time counter is removed from Roiling Horror while it's exiled, target player loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.</CardText>
<Artist>John Avon</Artist>
<Multiverseid>122431</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: You never choose an opponent, and the opponent that <Roiling Horror> looks at is never "locked in." <Roiling Horror> continuously looks at the life totals of all opponents and uses whichever value is the largest.
2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2007/02/01: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "play this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2007/02/01: If your life total is less than or equal to the life total of the opponent with the most life, <Roiling Horror>'s toughness is 0 or less. It will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2007/02/01: You target an opponent when you cast <Shrouded Lore>. The opponent chooses a card in your graveyard as <Shrouded Lore> resolves. After that choice is made, you're given the option to pay {B}. If you do, the targeted opponent must choose a different card, if there is one. (If there isn't one, this part is skipped.) Then you're given the option to pay {B} again. As long as you keep paying {B}, the process continues. As soon as you decline to pay {B}, the last card that was chosen by the opponent is put into your hand.
2007/02/01: The spell has no knowledge of cards chosen for other spells named <Shrouded Lore>.

<ManaCost>2RR (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Detritivore's power and toughness are each equal to the number of nonbasic land cards in your opponents' graveyards.
Suspend X—{X}{3}{R}. X can't be 0. (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {X}{3}{R} and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
Whenever a time counter is removed from Detritivore while it's exiled, destroy target nonbasic land.</CardText>
<Artist>Paolo Parente</Artist>
<Multiverseid>126811</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2007/02/01: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "play this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2007/02/01: The triggered ability is mandatory. If no other player has any nonbasic lands on the battlefield, you must target one of your own.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<ManaCost>3G (4)</ManaCost>
<CardText>Fungal Behemoth's power and toughness are each equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on creatures you control.
Suspend X—{X}{G}{G}. X can't be 0. (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {X}{G}{G} and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
Whenever a time counter is removed from Fungal Behemoth while it's exiled, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.</CardText>
<Artist>Mark Tedin</Artist>
<Multiverseid>124065</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: Both instances of X in the suspend ability are the same. You determine the value of X as you suspend the card from your hand. The value you choose must be at least 1.
2007/02/01: If this is suspended, then when the last time counter is removed from it, both its triggered ability and the "play this card" part of the suspend ability will trigger. They can be put on the stack in either order.
2007/02/01: Any +1/+1 counters on <Fungal Behemoth> itself count toward its base power and toughness, then give it a power and toughness bonus. For example, if there are two +1/+1 counters on <Fungal Behemoth> and three on other creatures you control, <Fungal Behemoth> is a 7/7 creature.
2013/06/07: A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).
2013/06/07: As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored.
2013/06/07: If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
2013/06/07: If the spell has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those if able. However, if an additional cost includes a mana payment, you are forced to pay that cost only if there's enough mana in your mana pool at the time you cast the spell. You aren't forced to activate any mana abilities, although you may do so if you wish.
2013/06/07: You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether or not you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
2013/06/07: Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
2013/06/07: If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
2013/06/07: If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
2013/06/07: When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
2013/06/07: If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.</Rulings>

<Artist>Mark Brill</Artist>
<Multiverseid>122468</Multiverseid>
<Rulings>2007/02/01: If you cast a 2/2 Grizzly Bears, for example, you may then search for any creature with total power and toughness 4. It can be 0/4, 1/3, 2/2, or 3/1.
2007/02/01: The game checks the power and toughness of the creature that just entered the battlefield as it exists on the battlefield. That might mean it's impossible to get another copy of that same card. For example, a Triskelion on the battlefield is 4/4, but a Triskelion in your library is 1/1. The power and toughness might also have been affected while the triggered ability was on the stack (such as with Giant Growth, Sudden Death, or Ovinize).
2007/02/01: If the creature that entered the battlefield has left the battlefield by the time the ability resolves, use the power and toughness of that creature as it last appeared before leaving the battlefield.</Rulings>

<Rulings>2018/12/07: <Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth> isn't a Swamp while it's not on the battlefield.
2018/12/07: Land cards not on the battlefield aren't Swamps while Urborg is on the battlefield.
2018/12/07: Urborg's ability causes each land on the battlefield to have the land type Swamp. Any land that's a Swamp has the ability "{T}: Add {B}." Nothing else changes about those lands, including their names, other subtypes, other abilities, and whether they're legendary, basic, or snow.</Rulings>
